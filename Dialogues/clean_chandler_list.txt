Chandler: All right Joey, benice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Chandler: Sounds like a date to me.
Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'mstanding in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's aphone... there.
Chandler: That's right.
Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. 
Chandler: Finally, I figureI'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Chandler: Cookie?
Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (Theyall stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! (Heextends his hand hopefully.)
Chandler: (imitating the characters)Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
Chandler: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearingthose pants. 
Chandler: Please don't do that again, it's ahorrible sound.
Chandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Chandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,was it?
Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excitedabout it. 
Chandler: It's a beautiful thing.
Chandler: I would have tosay that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Chandler: I have noidea.
Chandler: All finished!
Chandler: Yes, please don't spoilall this fun.
Chandler: Oh, God.
Chandler: Oh my God!
Chandler: You must stop! (Chandlerhits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
Chandler: Look, Ross, you gottaunderstand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, andthat is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
Chandler: Stay out of my freezer! [Scene: ARestaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]
Chandler: Angela's the screamer,Andrea has cats.
Chandler: That is amazing.
Chandler: If can invade Poland,there isn't anything I can't do.
Chandler: Hi, Paul, is it?
Chandler: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If Idon't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... 
Chandler: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Chandler: You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into songand dances out of the door.) "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
Chandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat. 
Chandler: Oh, how well you know me... 
Chandler: (as Rachel is cutting upher cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. 
Chandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it? 
Chandler: Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachelsits down to hear Chandler's dream.)
Chandler: Okay, so, I'm in LasVegas... I'm Liza Minelli- 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act,y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floydcomes out. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how greatthe show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we'rein the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three'sCompany where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then Irealised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him)...now I wish I was dead. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of achild's pillow. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ringin a lasagne... 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parentsactually preferred. 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Chandler: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearingalcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 
Chandler: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog tosleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 
Chandler: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" 
Chandler: Hey, that was really good! 
Chandler: Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?" 
Chandler: "Smoke away." 
Chandler: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. 
Chandler: Relax your hand! 
Chandler: Not so much! 
Chandler: Hey! 
Chandler: Alright, now try taking a puff. 
Chandler: Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. 
Chandler: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. 
Chandler: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's beenmissing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. 
Chandler: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my..God. (He continues to smoke.) 
Chandler: Oh, Satan's minions at work again... 
Chandler: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. 
Chandler: And this- is my reward! 
Chandler: Okay, so this time I won't quit! 
Chandler: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it inPhoebe's coffee.) 
Chandler: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..Sorry. 
Chandler: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression) 
Chandler: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two aboutsoftball.. 
Chandler: I personally could have a gallon of Alan. 
Chandler: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? 
Chandler: Hey, this is so unfair! 
Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-crackingisn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, withthat snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all thoseflaws, why can't you accept me for this? 
Chandler: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and youremphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. 
Chandler: Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, shetold you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it'snot that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like thatbefore. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.) 
Chandler: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand forthirty years it'd be talking too. 
Chandler: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that waswrong? 
Chandler: (deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. 
Chandler: (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! 
Chandler: ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. 
Chandler: (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I'vegotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! 
Chandler: (returns) Yeah, alright.
Chandler: Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..make myself omnipotent forever. 
Chandler: You got waaaay too much free time. 
Chandler: Happy birthday, pal! 
Chandler: Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass ishalf empty." 
Chandler: Eleven days before Halloween.. all thegood costumes are gone? 
Chandler: (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch himin the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? 
Chandler: (stops) I have no idea. 
Chandler: You got it.
Chandler: (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. 
Chandler: ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passesit to Joey.) 
Chandler: We'll take a brief time out while Messierstops to look at some women's shoes. 
Chandler: Yes, Bunny? 
Chandler: (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
Chandler: What? There was ice there that night withCarol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? 
Chandler: (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. 
Chandler: He's open! 
Chandler: Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! 
Chandler: (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
Chandler: Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, Iguess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
Chandler: Excuse me, look, we've been here for overan hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy withthe toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talksthrough it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said somethings we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To thewaiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! 
Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magicalfeeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? 
Chandler: Well, what? What? What is it? That sheleft you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? 
Chandler: Then what? 
Chandler: So in your whole life, you've only beenwith one(He gets a look too)oh. 
Chandler: I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,it's romantic... 
Chandler: No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Rossenters off camera) 
Chandler: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence ofthe Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. 
Chandler: You gotta do it, man. 
Chandler: Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves) 
Chandler: Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa cardpeople. 
Chandler: Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel. 
Chandler: To the left, to the left- aww! (They allcollapse) 
Chandler: We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Chandler: So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night,Sat-ur-day night!
Chandler: Not a one.
Chandler: Oh, right, right, shut up.
Chandler: No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sittingthere with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courageto do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Chandler: Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. 
Chandler: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Chandler: Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thingthrough?
Chandler: It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You'regoing on a date.
Chandler: Yuh-huh.
Chandler: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically thefirst time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
Chandler: Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Chandler: There you go.
Chandler: Where are they? Where are they?
Chandler: It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over somepuppies.
Chandler: Here we go.
Chandler: Hey, Janice.
Chandler: Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here,please?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: (covering) What... did you get me there? 
Chandler: Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Chandler: That's great. 
Chandler: Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
Chandler: That's it?
Chandler: Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Chandler: Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go outanymore. Janice.
Chandler: Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different.I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand outand hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
Chandler: Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Chandler: (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is theworst break-up in the history of the world. 
Chandler: Oh, I don't know, a million?
Chandler: I'm fine.
Chandler: I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Chandler: How do you do that?
Chandler: We should always always break up together.
Chandler: I'm free! I'm free!
Chandler: You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before.Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
Chandler: (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.
Chandler: No, ten o'clock.
Chandler: (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight,nine, ten o'clock!
Chandler: She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short,fat, bald men!
Chandler: Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me.Blarrglarrghh.'
Chandler: Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross,back me up here.
Chandler: Thank you, buddy.
Chandler: Y'think?
Chandler: Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very veryaware of my tongue...
Chandler: Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
Chandler: Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is myname, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
Chandler: Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say,what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou,goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.) 
Chandler: (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play,man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, theusher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)
Chandler: Hey, kids. 
Chandler: Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and youhaven't asked me how my date went.
Chandler: It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had themost amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Chandler: Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and Irode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
Chandler: We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more orless.
Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Chandler: Who's Rick?
Chandler: Oh, so you're divorced?
Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
Chandler: So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about yousitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the changein my pocket?
Chandler: Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Chandler: So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship doyou imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Chandler: ...Hm.
Chandler: What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't youlisten to the story?
Chandler: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way Ilook at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and noneof the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
Chandler: Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Chandler: Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'llscratch your eyes right out.
Chandler: Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's acold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer andcloser to the surface of the wood...
Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, afterall your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way intoshowbusiness.
Chandler: Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Chandler: C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runsback out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
Chandler: Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things,Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Chandler: Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (Hestarts to raid the fridge.)
Chandler: No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in arelationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of yourlife? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted aboutthirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?(He has armloads of stuff.)
Chandler: God, I love these fingers...
Chandler: No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy theyare.
Chandler: Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls herback down.)
Chandler: Don't go.
Chandler: (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.
Chandler: Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
Chandler: What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
Chandler: I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regretasking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Chandler: Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick,Ethan and myself?
Chandler: Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
Chandler: You.
Chandler: Nono, just you.
Chandler: Lose the other guys.
Chandler: C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Chandler: ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys,y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy.Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizesand breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out!Get out!'
Chandler: I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactlylet each other finish...
Chandler: ...The second guy.
Chandler: Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Chandler: (to Ross) "Big guy?"
Chandler: Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Chandler: Oh, great. This is just...
Chandler: Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something...something Goodacre.
Chandler: She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped inan ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's anatrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Chandler: Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Chandler: Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy lastnight. Yes, he was some guy. 
Chandler: Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutesand you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
Chandler: There you go!
Chandler: You're definitely scaring here.
Chandler: Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.(takes phone)
Chandler: Hey, it's me.
Chandler: Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in anATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Chandler: I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Chandler: (angry) Put Joey on the phone.
Chandler: I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Chandler: Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Chandler: Um, is it sugarless?
Chandler: Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If JillGoodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you takeit.
Chandler: You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives hima stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would beperfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no,no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Chandler: (chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble'sgood. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Chandler: Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over andput it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back inhis mouth.)
Chandler: Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewingsomeone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you'rechoking. 
Chandler: (gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Chandler: OK.
Chandler: Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving mylife.
Chandler: Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you gotany of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Chandler: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it getbetter than this?
Chandler: Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or'self-destructive'...
Chandler: Yes please.
Chandler: He's a he?
Chandler: ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is thatridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Chandler: You did?
Chandler: Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you firstmet me?
Chandler: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Chandler: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
Chandler: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Chandler: WHAT IS IT?!
Chandler: Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna bevague about this.
Chandler: I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Chandler: Hey, gorgeous.
Chandler: No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently otherpeople have made the same mistake.
Chandler: So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Chandler: ...Quality, right, great.
Chandler: Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Chandler: Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Chandler: No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up withsomeone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Chandler: Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could geta Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Chandler: Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn'tit?
Chandler: Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Chandler: You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Chandler: You are a frightening, frightening man.
Chandler: Oh, no-
Chandler: Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Who are those people?
Chandler: Hey, Lowell.
Chandler: So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Chandler: Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but,uh... I'm not.
Chandler: Really.
Chandler: So- you can tell?
Chandler: So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Chandler: He is?
Chandler: Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If Iwanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Chandler: That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like JoeyTribbiani, man slash woman.
Chandler: Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Chandler: Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Chandler: Yes, every single one of them.
Chandler: I thought it was $98.50.
Chandler: I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact,I'd very much like to butter your head.
Chandler: All right, I'm nine years old.
Chandler: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and Iremember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parentschoose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Chandler: Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner onceyou've seen it in reverse.
Chandler: Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Chandler: Oh, you must stop shooping.
Chandler: No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Chandler: Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's notfunny anymore.
Chandler: The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gottenaway.
Chandler: No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's allover the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spottedflying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
Chandler: Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How oftendoes that happen?
Chandler: Do either of you have the keys?
Chandler: (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
Chandler: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open.Here we go.
Chandler: Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Chandler: Shall I carve?
Chandler: Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Chandler: I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know thisisn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has beenreally great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been withyour family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivingssucked.
Chandler: Here, here!
Chandler: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Chandler: Might wanna open with the snowman.
Chandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horriblepressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you canhave someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Chandler: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Chandler: Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. 
Chandler: (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!
Chandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonnaask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break thepact.
Chandler: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
Chandler: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Chandler: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Chandler: Too many jokes... must mock Joey! 
Chandler: Aah, y'killing me!
Chandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Chandler: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Chandler: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Chandler: I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Chandler: That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Chandler: Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Chandler: With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Chandler: Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and amelon...
Chandler: You remember Janice.
Chandler: (Imitating) But you found me!
Chandler: Kill me. Kill me now. 
Chandler: Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when Iinvited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Chandler: I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Chandler: Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)
Chandler: (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me.(Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)
Chandler: Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica'sbedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how totell you.
Chandler: And the moment of joy is upon us.
Chandler: Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz,but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)
Chandler: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebodykiss me!
Chandler: Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Chandler: Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's ison Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Chandler: Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in thegroin twenty, thirty times! No?
Chandler: Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years oldand all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Chandler: You can say that because she's not your mom.
Chandler: Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Chandler: Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Chandler: THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Chandler: This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Chandler: ...And then he burst into flames.
Chandler: Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Chandler: Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Chandler: I know I am.
Chandler: Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Chandler: What are you guys doing out here?
Chandler: Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back insideand shuts the door)
Chandler: Oh my God. 
Chandler: I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: (To Joey) You knew about this?
Chandler: I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Chandler: (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Chandler: Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with mymom more than you. 
Chandler: I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
Chandler: I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Chandler: You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
Chandler: What was that?
Chandler: Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?(Goes to the counter)
Chandler: Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudiannightmare. 
Chandler: Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
Chandler: That's very funny. We done now?
Chandler: That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with mymom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Chandler: No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Chandler: You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Chandler: Really stupid.
Chandler: Yeah. No. No...
Chandler: Yeah, okay.
Chandler: Nice save.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
Chandler: Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. 
Chandler: Pretty good! I told her.
Chandler: No-no-no-no, we're done.
Chandler: And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
Chandler: (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Chandler: Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Chandler: You think?
Chandler: Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
Chandler: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Chandler: Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your littlebreakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Chandler: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter leftlittle to the imagination.
Chandler: What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Chandler: You think we're ready for something like that?
Chandler: Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants tomove out?
Chandler: I'm not moving out. 
Chandler: Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Chandler: It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off andgot married, and things got pretty ugly.
Chandler: Aw, don't do that
Joey and Chandler: Hey Phoebe!
Chandler: Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
Chandler: More coffee over here, please!
Joey and Chandler:  Ooooohh!
Chandler: So what are you gonna do?
Chandler: Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
Chandler: That's patio furniture!
Chandler: (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
Chandler: You pick one.
Chandler: Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest finedining!
Chandler: Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joeyturns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
Chandler: So, what do you think?
Chandler: I know!
Chandler: What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it'stime for you to swoop in!
Chandler: My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her.You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look offinto the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)
Chandler: Wha-
Joey and Chandler: What is it?
Chandler: Hey!
Joey and Chandler: We already knew that! (they hug)
Joey and Chandler: Shut-out!! (They both start heading fortheir rooms.)
Chandler: Yeah, get out!
Chandler: (to Joey) One more game?
Chandler: I'm sorry!
Chandler: Rachel, wait, wait.
Chandler: Can I just say one thing?
Chandler: That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipularareas.
Chandler: Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Chandler: It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescopeand a box of donuts.
Chandler: Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very niceboobies.
Chandler: Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.
Chandler: Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Chandler: Huh.
Chandler: Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Chandler: (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?
Chandler: Y'know, I don't see that happening?
Chandler: Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
Chandler: (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.
Chandler: Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Chandler: Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Chandler: Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Chandler: Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Chandler: So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Chandler: C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's notfollowed by "No thanks, it's late." 
Chandler: Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Chandler: Well, you're gonna.
Chandler: Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Chandler: Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to gointo your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Chandler: No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now thatwasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comesalong, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Chandler: Yeah. I really do.
Chandler: Get off!
Chandler: (Comes out of his room) What? What?
Chandler: Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
Chandler: Basically we just feel that he's...
Chandler: Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Chandler: If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasingafter twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Chandler: Any contact?
Chandler: Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachelthing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third... 
Chandler: I think it's winning.
Chandler: She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Chandler: No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
Chandler: Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Chandler: Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Chandler: Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches inRoss' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?
Chandler: Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember,no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Chandler: ...And what did you bring?
Chandler: Janice?
Chandler: (angrily) Hey, it's Janice.
Chandler: Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. 
Chandler: Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumpedtwice in the last five months!
Chandler: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey andyells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Chandler: That's OK.
Chandler: (disgusted) What? What can't you do?
Chandler: Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Chandler: Ok, you can not do this to me.
Chandler: I hope she throws up on you.
Chandler: So...
Chandler: Oh, what a crappy night!
Chandler: Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up...other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
Chandler: Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card.Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Chandler: You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could weget a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Chandler: That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've alwayswanted to know...
Chandler: No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Chandler: Ok, well, this was very special.
Chandler: Janice is gonna go away now.
Chandler: Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Chandler: How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Chandler: Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Chandler: Hi, Just Janice.
Chandler: Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan andJan Forever.
Chandler: Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tellyou this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't thingsare gonna work out.
Chandler: (surprised) It is?
Chandler: Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Chandler: Oh, no I don't.
Chandler: I did, but...
Chandler: Call me!
Chandler: Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a veryflattering sleeve length on you.
Chandler: Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to dowith them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken fromthe woman.) Nothing.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Alcalls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
Chandler: So.... I quit.
Chandler: Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Chandler: If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what Iactually do.
Chandler: It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's inhis office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Chandler: Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Chandler: I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I justknow I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Chandler: Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it'san all-toast restaurant.
Chandler: Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Chandler: Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Chandler: Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, careercounselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the "a-gogo."
Chandler: Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
Chandler: Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do.You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Chandler: Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Chandler: Who are you going out with?
Chandler: And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Chandler: Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests,personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "Youare ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinationalcorporation."
Chandler: Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should bedoing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doingsomething...something.
Chandler: Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better splitthis with you.
Chandler: (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Chandler: You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in'76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)
Chandler: (smiling)....with??
Chandler: It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to gettogether.
Chandler: Again?
Chandler: (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?(Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pensfrom your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look,this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something Ican really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure youmentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This isnot a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'mtelling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you onMonday! (slams the phone down)
Chandler: Well?
Chandler: Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
Chandler: Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
Chandler: (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check thisout, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
Chandler: This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could youcome in here for a moment? 
Chandler: Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Chandler: Last time I do that, I promise.
Chandler: (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at theWENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell yousomething... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slamsphone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....
Chandler: This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was acartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Chandler: Its Phoebe! Hi!
Chandler: Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Chandler: Can we start over?
Chandler: All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly likeher sister.
Chandler: Theyre twins!
Chandler: You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Chandler: Lets not do that any more.
Chandler: Your sister Ursula.
Chandler: Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Chandler: Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Chandler: Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Chandler: And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, Helen.
Chandler: Oh, okay. Send her in.
Chandler: Hi, Nina. Come on in.
Chandler: Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and littlething, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Chandler: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Chandler: WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...
Chandler: Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that...shes really really cute.
Chandler: (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving theChristmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Chandler: Hey, where you been?
Chandler: Score.
Chandler: Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna runit by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)
Chandler: Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
Chandler: And?
Chandler: So what does this mean?
Chandler: Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and myhair was very very &amp;ndash;
Chandler: Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (Inpain) Nina.
Chandler: (Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that Icalled you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Chandler: (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Chandler: Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Chandler: Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Rachel and Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Chandler: Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kindof capade.
Chandler: Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Chandler: And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Chandler: Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go,err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan. 
Chandler: And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact,he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Chandler: Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she iswhooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have norecollection of being fired at all, none at all.
Chandler: And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can beassured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Chandler: Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
Chandler: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys andbabies are actually different.
Chandler: Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
Chandler: Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, ofus.
Chandler: Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Chandler: Sure, why not?
Chandler: Oh, you dont know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make surewe put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
Chandler: Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?
Chandler: Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Chandler: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.)Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave yourhand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.
Chandler: Youre not gonna lose him.
Chandler: Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to workfor.
Chandler: You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go outwith her again?
Chandler: Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've reallyhappened' thing?
Chandler: ...little playthings with yarn?
Chandler: Could you want her more?
Chandler: (sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Chandler: We're notwe're not saying anything.
Chandler: (to the girls) We were playing poker, alright...
Chandler: And then he did.
Chandler: There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Chandler: (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.
Chandler: OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Chandler: (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Chandler: OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up twocards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal thecards.
Chandler: Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Chandler: The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving usthe land, so...
Chandler: Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put themtogether yourself, but they cost a little less.
Chandler: Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Chandler: Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking):"When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Chandler: Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're allrecommending Trident?
Chandler: Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don'tknow... Pictionary?
Chandler: That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This wayI can break 'em up with a movie.
Chandler: Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Chandler: Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
Chandler: Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Chandler: Call.
Chandler: (to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?
Chandler: Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)
Chandler: Good luck.
Chandler: (to Ross): I thought we had them!
Chandler: Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport'77! Airport '79!
Chandler: Go.
Chandler: Toootal chick-flick.
Chandler: They're still just friends, right?
Chandler: I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Chandler: I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, theywould've happened already?
Chandler: I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Chandler: Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the1890's, when that phrase was last used.
Chandler: Rachel lost Marcel.
Chandler: Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some ofthe touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Chandler: Marcel?
Chandler: Marcel?
Chandler: Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking forsomething...
Chandler: Yes have you seen any?
Chandler: Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything aboutradiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating andcooling... mileu.
Chandler: Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they'revery hot.
Chandler: Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Chandler: Marcel?!
Chandler: Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Chandler: Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex Ihad would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Chandler: I can't believe you would actually say that. I would muchrather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
Chandler: I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Chandler: I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as oneof the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally beourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Chandler: Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls makedisgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'mright, right?
Chandler: Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, thenhurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
Chandler: No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Chandler: Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended upusing the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Chandler: (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Chandler: Hey Rach!
Chandler: Yes!
Chandler: I have my reasons.
Chandler: (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting themachine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangsup.) Oh God!
Chandler: Hey, I've been honing!
Chandler: Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? Imight have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the pastfew hours.
Chandler: What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Chandler: Can I use your phone?
Chandler: Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Chandler: Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Chandler: Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
Chandler: She answered.
Chandler: I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and ischoosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
Chandler: If it helps, I could slide over.
Chandler: Hello? Hello?
Chandler: So how's Mindy?
Chandler: Hell is filled with people like you.
Chandler: ...And boogie!
Chandler: Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Chandler: Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Chandler: I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Chandler: No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine.Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, Iaccidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.(Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonnacall me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call meback, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Chandler: 'S'why I'm dancing...
Chandler: Ring dammit, ring!
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Chandler: Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Chandler: Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
Chandler: What are you doing here?
Chandler: ...I'm, I'm okay.
Chandler: That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: ...I dunno.
Chandler: Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing abouther coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
Chandler: Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Chandler: Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Chandler: How about Joey... Pepponi?
Chandler: Joey... Switzerland?
Chandler: Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Chandler: Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Chandler: Might wanna try Joseph.
Chandler: Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is theFiddler on the Roof.
Chandler: She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Chandler: So what does this mean?
Chandler: I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adultalready?
Chandler: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Chandler: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's atotal party zoo.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Chandler: ...Take off their hats!
Chandler: You're kidding.
Chandler: Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Chandler: ...He's in.
Chandler: Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in SanDiego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Chandler: Tell me what?
Chandler: (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason whywomen won't look at me.
Chandler: Wow!
Chandler: More importantly, was I any good?
Chandler: Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.(Monica pats him on his lap)
Chandler: You're okay there?
Chandler: I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i wassomebody else's subconscious.
Chandler: Hello Rachel.
Chandler: Pirates again?
Chandler: (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Chandler: Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She ishaving one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.
Chandler: Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, becauseit involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Chandler: A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Chandler: When we were?
Chandler: Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Chandler: Can you hear that?
Chandler: See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Chandler: I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Ah!
Chandler: Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Bye bye.
Chandler: (answering it) Yes?
Chandler: Ooh. (leans against the desk)
Chandler: See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonderwhat he means) Me.
Chandler: Why not?
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Chandler: What are you talking about?
Chandler: I can't belive it.
Chandler: They do me?
Chandler: I don't sound like that.
Chandler: Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Chandler: That is so not... That is so not...That... Oh, shut up!
Chandler: Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Chandler: Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Chandler: And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to getout of gym.
Chandler: Tyrannosaurus!
Chandler: Work people? Nobody told me.
Chandler: You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends.You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Chandler: You think I should?
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and Idoing Ebony and Ivory.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Then, I don't get it.
Chandler: They do?
Chandler: I just wan't to...

Chandler: Yeah, like in a cab...
Chandler: Okay, hating this.
Chandler: Here we go, here we go.
Chandler: Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the50's.
Chandler: You have to pick your moments.
Chandler: I used to have that bumper sticker.
Chandler: (to Rachel) You see what I mean.
Chandler: Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Chandler: Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Chandler: You'll get one.
Chandler: All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us aremarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Chandler: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Chandler: No, no, no.
Chandler: (trapped) Uh, uh.
Chandler: Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the backof the chair he was sitting in)
Chandler: Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, yourfather a doctor? 
Chandler: No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)
Chandler: Where have you been?
Chandler: Mazel tov!
Chandler: (to Joey) You are really frightening me.
Chandler: Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull herhand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?
Chandler: (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian lifepartner?
Chandler: I know, I still am one of these.
Chandler: And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.(Does a baseball sign.)
Chandler: Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walksover to where Joey is seated)
Chandler: Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now oweme... 17 jillion dollars.
Chandler: (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
Chandler: (in a deep voice) Men are here.
Chandler: Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Chandler: Crazy bitch.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Chandler: Forget about her.
Chandler: Course there, they just call it food.
Chandler: I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Chandler: (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
Chandler: (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.
Chandler: Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Chandler: Oh, that's Ross's. 
Chandler: Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his TravelScrabble game)
Chandler: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love withCarol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Chandler: (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Chandler: (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
Chandler: (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
Chandler: No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Chandler: OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Chandler: (quickly) H-He's in China!
Chandler: What about the time difference?
Chandler: Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
Chandler: Well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
Chandler: Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)
Chandler: Hey, big...
Chandler: (quietly) ...spender.
Chandler: So how'd it go?
Chandler: The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you knowme.
Chandler: Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the paraderoute.
Chandler: I didn't know you had another level.
Chandler: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Chandler: Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Chandler:  No way!
Chandler: Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Chandler: Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
Chandler: Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I liketo be surprised.
Chandler: Hey, Rach, can I get...
Chandler: Not yet.
Chandler: So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we leftyou, you were totally in love with, you know.
Chandler: God?
Chandler: Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Chandler: Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Chandler: He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'msorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all byhimself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.
Chandler: You have to really wanna see it.
Chandler: (entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Chandler: No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Chandler: Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Chandler: Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Chandler: What stupid thing did you do?
Chandler: People do stupid things when they're upset.
Chandler: Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've gotpants that need to be altered.
Chandler: Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Chandler: At least as long as I have the pants.
Chandler: (entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause)Your tailor is a very bad man!
Chandler: Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Chandler: Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his handup my leg, and then, there was definite...
Chandler: Cupping.
Chandler: Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught betweenthe moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Chandler: That's ok.
Chandler: You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him)something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)
Chandler: We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Chandler: Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question aboutbreast-feeding?
Chandler: So, uh, how often can you do it?
Chandler: Hey, sweetums.
Chandler: Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That'slike cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Chandler: What did you just do?
Chandler: What did you just do?
Chandler: Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Chandler: Howdy.
Chandler: Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Chandler: (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do youcare? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Chandler: (pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that.You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. Andthen where're you gonna run?
Chandler: You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're madeof. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre westof the lingerie.
Chandler: All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nicehooker.

Chandler: Huh. (They all leave, dejected)
Chandler: Morning.
Chandler: Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Chandler: Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home fromwork today and just hang out with me.
Chandler: I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is gettingdivorced. I'm such a grown up.
Chandler: Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Chandler: Nope, not this time.
Chandler: I'm not yanking you.
Chandler: Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Chandler: (looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare ateach other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Of!
Chandler: You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I gotthree tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Chandler: No, Janice.
Chandler: You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have aproblem with Janice?
Chandler: Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Chandler: Well, there you go.
Chandler: Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Chandler: I want you to say that you like her!
Chandler: Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and bythe way there is no Count Rushmore!
Chandler: Umm, yeah.
Chandler: Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? 
Chandler: We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Chandler: Yeah, okay.
Chandler: Yeah! All right! You go first.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Chandler: I know!
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Chandler: And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all theselike, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at theXerox place....
Chandler: I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. Andyour like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can'tpossibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it'skinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!
Chandler: You said...
Chandler: What are you guys doing together?
Chandler: Really.
Chandler: You still can't stand her can you?
Chandler: Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Chandler: Well, I guess that's something.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Oh God!
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: Taste it.
Chandler: Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Chandler: Hey, mister tux!
Chandler: (entering from bathroom, with an issue of Cosmo) All right, I took thequiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. (to Joey) Get up.
Chandler: You're in my seat.
Chandler: 'Cause I was sitting there.
Chandler: Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew Iwas coming back.
Chandler: The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Chandler: All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not abig deal. (yells at Joey) GET UP!!
Chandler: Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.
Chandler: Really!
Chandler: Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
Chandler: You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I justhope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches infront of Joey's face) Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Nottouching can't get mad! (Joey flings some dip onto Phoebe's dress)
Chandler: Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Chandler: All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. (sits onJoey's lap) I'm soooo, comfortable.
Chandler: All right! (jumps up)
Chandler: All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, andI'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! (leaves)
Chandler: Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Chandler: All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, havenoticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair,dillhole!"
Chandler: What are you doing?
Chandler: The cushions are the essence of the chair!
Chandler: Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Chandler: We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Chandler: (shyly) The sheep.
Chandler: He took my essence!
Chandler: Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody hiscushions.
Chandler: What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Chandler: He's got nothing!
Chandler: What are you supporting?
Chandler: Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Chandler: (to Phoebe) You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. Butwhenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean,what is that about?
Chandler: They got a phone in there, right?
Chandler: Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Chandler: Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!! 
Chandler: Oooo-ooh!
Chandler: Jeez, what a baby.
Chandler: Stop it. Stop it!
Chandler: Excuse me. Hi.
Chandler: Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Chandler: I mean, I was sitting there.
Chandler: But, I never left the room!
Chandler: All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
Chandler: (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you notto jump on the bed.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that itjust *fell* out of the socket.
Chandler: Because the kids need new shoes.
Chandler: Do I look fat?
Chandler: Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took thatto mean that I was calling her a cow. 
Chandler: Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked ather....
Chandler: Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Chandler: That's easy, baggage claim.
Chandler: Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janicelikes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want togo to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know,accidentally calling her fat or something.
Chandler: Thank you Rachel.
Chandler: Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Chandler: Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: Okay, the old hug and roll.
Chandler: Okay, one question.
Chandler: You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Chandler: Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Chandler: Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holdsup one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)
Chandler: Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Chandler: That, that's what's stupid.
Chandler: Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look atall that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weirdthough. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes!Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay,time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat!And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)
Chandler: No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
Chandler: You mean there's more than one of us.
Chandler: And that's how you bought it?
Chandler: Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Chandler: Sure. What's up?
Chandler: You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Chandler: Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Chandler: Hey, man. What's up?
Chandler: Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Chandler: Is anybody else scared?
Chandler: Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Chandler: (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Chandler: Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to seeher tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Chandler: Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half herchicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Chandler: Noo.
Chandler: No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarmstarted going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Chandler: I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train ofthought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to saysomething stupid.
Chandler: Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid ofthe commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! 
Chandler: Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do wehave any thoughts here?
Chandler: You think?
Chandler: Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'mpretty much peeing every which way.
Chandler: 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)
Chandler: Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go intoyour brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Chandler: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's whatgirlfriends should, should get. 
Chandler: Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there'smore. We should take a trip.
Chandler: Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet yourparents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Chandler: I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I havefeared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probablysay 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Chandler: It doesn't scare me!
Chandler: Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'mhopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janiceto leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wannaapologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)
Chandler: So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is goingto fast and we have to slow down.
Chandler: Then I got all needy and clingy.
Chandler: She said she'd call me.
Chandler: Oh God.
Chandler: This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Chandler: So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Chandler: Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Chandler: So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Chandler: I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Chandler: (in a British accent) Hello, Janice.
Chandler: (in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Chandler: (normal voice) No. Not anymore.
Chandler: Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for aparty. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)
Chandler: Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Chandler: Here in Chelsea.
Chandler: A woman's
Chandler: (shyly) Chelsea.
Chandler: Can I be that guy?
Chandler: ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ranout of the store.
Chandler: I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice creamnow, right?
Chandler: (answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second?Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?
Chandler: Hello!
Chandler: What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'mso glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately.

Chandler: Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Chandler: All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she puthim on her freebie list.
Chandler: Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities thatwe can sleep with, and the other one cant get mad.

Chandler: You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city.
Chandler: No, you didnt get me!! Its an electric drill, you getme, you kill me!!

Chandler: Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottomhalf of the door.)
Chandler: All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Chandler: Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Chandler: Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldntlet you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Chandler: Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes toointernational, y'know shes never gonna be around.
Chandler: So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in thecountry like all the time.
Chandler: (entering) Have you seen Joey?
Chandler: Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back ofhis pants.) Yknow what its my fault really, because the couch is usually wherewe keep the varnish.

Chandler: Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls arenice?
Chandler: Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her somethingspeacial. Come in here with me.

Chandler: She doesnt know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up thismorning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying thattwelve pack of condoms. And now I cant even return them, because she choked on thereciept!
Chandler: I dont know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Chandler: Come on, tell me.
Chandler: What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joeyquickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?
Chandler: Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let meget through it, because its, its, its not gonna be easy.
Chandler: I think you should go back with Gary. I dont wanna be the guythat breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know Youre the reason, you arethe reason why their not together. and I hated that guy. And it didnt matterhow nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Chandler: Yeah, well. Its the right thing to do.
Chandler: Then dont leave me!
Chandler: Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!

Chandler: Yeah, all right, Ill play.
Chandler: No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Chandler: And was the curse lifted?
Chandler: But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, becausemy Mom wont let me cross the street.
Chandler: And then Tineals.
Chandler: Wow! Just like in the pros.
Chandler: The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball butkicks Rosss foot instead.)
Chandler: Sorry. Im sorry. Y'know what, were just gonna throw it.
Chandler: No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.

Chandler: Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Chandler: (reading the comics) Eh..., I dont, I dont know.
Chandler: Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should stillbe allowed to fly this thing?
Chandler: (thinks about it) Yeah?
Chandler: Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Chandler: I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Chandler: (reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on SeasameStreet last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Chandler: Look out kids, hes coming! (Ross continues to leave with hishead down in shame.)
Chandler: Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most ofthem, its the only chance to see New York.
Chandler: Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Chandler: How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending outresumes like what, two years ago?
Chandler: Hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to goafter a job you really want.
Chandler: Because, Im too afraid.
Chandler: Yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and stillworking here.
Chandler: (to Joey) Does this mean were gonna have to start paying forcoffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)
Chandler: I spelled out boobies.
Chandler: So, how many have you sold so far?
Chandler: Oh my God, how did you do that?
Chandler: Me! On my computer.
Chandler: Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squadco-captain only took up so much room.
Chandler: Something else I might have said?
Chandler: You-you-you dont wanna give into the fear.
Chandler: Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)
Chandler: Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Chandler: (to Rachel, whos entering) Hey! Howd the interview go?
Chandler: Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at thecoffee house.
Chandler: Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up myChristmas.
Chandler: Its like Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.
Chandler: Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
Chandler: (to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?
Chandler: Im an alien. Im an alien.
Chandler: (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long witha little nouse at the end?
Chandler: I just saw Janice. 
Chandler: Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, shelooked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kids pretzel at them.
Chandler: Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Chandler: Oh, y'know what, Im gonna be okay, you dont have to throwa party for me.
Chandler: Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Chandler: Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, itssupposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Chandler: Hello-dillillio!!

Chandler: Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Chandler: (to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Chandler: Hi Joeys sisters!
Chandler: Oh, Im taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Chandler: No-no-no-no, no, its a good thing. Why must we dial so speedilyanyway? Why must we rush through life? Why cant we savor the precious moments? (toone of Joeys sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.
Chandler: Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.
Chandler: Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Chandler: Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing. 
Chandler: Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well,thats not the worst part. 
Chandler: I cant remember which sister.
Chandler: Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
Chandler: (to Monica) You see you cant tell which one is which either,dwha!!
Chandler: Veronica. Look, its got to be Veronica, the girl in the redskirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Chandler: Look, when Ive been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overlyfriendly, and Im sorry.
Chandler: Why cant we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
Chandler: Its gotta be the first one.
Chandler: Yep, Im in a tree.
Chandler: Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France.When actually Ill be in Cuba.
Chandler: What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Chandler: (shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doinghere?
Chandler: Im here to see Mary-Angela.
Chandler: Wheres Mary-Angela?
Chandler: This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
Chandler: Well, its, its yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Chandler: So um, Mary-Angela, whats your second favorite?
Chandler: Would you just please....give me the receipt cause this isgreat. Its top notch.
Chandler: So will I.
Chandler: Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesnt mean anything.
Chandler: Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)
Chandler: (startled) Hey!
Chandler: Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but heducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and Im not really ina, in a commitment kind of place.
Chandler: Ahhhh, youre not Mary-Angela.
Chandler: This is so bad. If-if youre not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
Chandler: Oh, this is soo bad. (doesnt see Mary-Angela)
Chandler: No Joey! No Joey! Dont Joey! Joey!
Chandler: (pats him on the shoulder) Youre it! Now run and hide!
Chandler: I wasnt sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joeyssisters gasp) Look, Im sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look reallysimilar.
Chandler: Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brothers notgoing to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?
Chandler: Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just wantyou to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, youre my bestfriend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Chandler: Okay, absolutely!
Chandler: Youve got it. (he starts to look at his sisters, but hestill doesnt know which one is Mary-Angela.)
Chandler: What?! (Cookie punches him)
Chandler: Dont worry.
Chandler: Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on thatas long as your wearing that towel dress. 
Chandler: All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Chandler: I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert,y'know he's the botanist. 
Chandler: Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? 
Chandler: (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys. 
Chandler: (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday? 
Chandler: Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about thebachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he cansee a stripper. 
Chandler: Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then allright. 
Chandler: Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!(pause) Don't cry outloud. 
Chandler: I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer. 
Chandler: I'll get you the Cliff Notes. 
Chandler: The abridgment. 
Chandler: ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with theAmerican Ballet Theater?! 
Chandler: Oh no, no, no, no. 
Chandler: All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello?(listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told thatyou do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred?(listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes? 
Chandler: Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier. 
Chandler: To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good. 
Chandler: Bye-bye. 
Chandler: What, what, what?! 
Chandler: You really think that is what he meant? 
Chandler: Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on herright away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too tocomplain about you. 
Chandler: Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already didthat. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a fewsurprise visits. 
Chandler: All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us,meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and shestarts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' 
Chandler: He paints quite a picture doesn't he? 
Chandler: Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See,she's fully dressed, right? 
Chandler: And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then youclick it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street,she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel juststares at him.) 
Chandler: Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. 
Chandler: Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can youpick me up some porn? 
Chandler: Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing) 
Chandler: Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to astripper. 
Chandler: Yeah, baby!
Chandler: Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Chandler: Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and nowshes celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Chandler: Oh, hey.
Chandler: (to Robert) So ah, isnt a bit cold out for shorts?
Chandler: Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Chandler: (standing up) Im up! Im up, Ive gotten up now!Anybody ah, want anything?
Chandler: Okay Ross, why dont you come with me?
Chandler: Roberts coming out.
Chandler: No. He.....hes coming out of his shorts.
Chandler: The man is showing brain.
Chandler: (to Ross) Wellll?
Chandler: What do we do? What do we do?
Chandler: Like an eclipse.
Chandler: Your liking it, huh?
Chandler: No, actually Lauries a boy.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: You mean a three pointer?
Chandler: Im sorry, Im sorry, it just seems that Robert isntas concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
Chandler: Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If Iwere you I would wear them every day, every day!
Chandler: Hmmm, thats very cool.
Chandler: I cant believe she cracked your code!
Chandler: No, Beth doesnt die, she doesnt die. Does she Rachel?
Chandler: We cant tell him, you cant go up to a guy you barely knowand talk about his.... stuff.
Chandler: Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Chandler: I like her.
Chandler: Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from thesepeople.
Chandler: (to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if theplace with the big fish comes up again. Id like know whether thats several bigfish or just one big fish.
Chandler: No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play calledwait until the last moment before I burst and die.
Chandler: Jeez, man did you fall..(sees its a beautiful woman coming outof the mens room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Chandler: (to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Imtalking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you sayyour name.
Chandler: Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so.... 
Chandler: Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you. (pause)Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)
Chandler: Well, thats the best kiss Ive had with anyone Iveever met in a mens room.
Chandler: (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all ina puddle.
Chandler: Yeah, were gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Chandler: No, really youre gonna freeze.
Chandler: Youre not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Chandler: Great. It was great. Shes ah, shes great, great looking,great personality, shes greatness.
Chandler: Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Chandler: Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnt have, but itdid. I mean I like her, I dont want to stop seeing her, but every so often itslike Hey, y'know what, wheres your leg? I mean Im the smallestperson in the world arent I? Im the smallest person in the world.
Chandler: (to Monica) Actually hes the smallest person in the world.
Chandler: It came up.
Chandler: No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Chandler: No. No. I dont think so.
Chandler: Thats-thats my nubbin.
Chandler: Its kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
Chandler: Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...(starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?
Chandler: You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Chandler: (entering, happily) Well hello!
Chandler: The doctor.
Chandler: Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, nowaiting.
Chandler: That was an obvious joke, and I didnt think of it.Why didnt I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
Chandler: (entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? Im going downto the Xerox place.
Chandler: Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Chandler: Yeah! You wanna come?
Chandler: Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Comeon Chloe!!
Chandler: Uh-oh.
Chandler: (to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.
Chandler: Well ah, ........y'know.
Chandler: All right, rock on. (Does the Hang 10 sign, then hides hisface in shame.)
Chandler: Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time didChloe say we should be there?
Chandler: What time is it now?
Chandler: Yeah all right, so well hang out.
Chandler: Yes. Vividly.
Chandler: Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah,I-I think so...
Chandler: Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Chandler: She was kidding.
Chandler: She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come upwith a set of ground rules.
Chandler: Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes areclosed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grabsomething with his hand.)
Chandler: Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Chandler: Well it you dont know that, then I dont want to do thiswith you.
Chandler: And thats the only colour that comes in.
Chandler: So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your biganniversary dinner.
Chandler: Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Chandler: Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Chandler: Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Chandler: Why? What happened to him?
Chandler: Oh my God! Oh my God!
Chandler: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the moreimportant question. How dumb are you?
Chandler: Hes right. Nobodys gonna benefit, and youre justgonna hurt her.
Chandler: All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least waituntil the timings right. And thats what deathbeds are for.
Chandler: Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issacssister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebesfriends with Rachel. And thats the trail, I did it!
Chandler: Off?!!
Chandler: Yeah, well I dont think you can make that statement, unlessyouve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Chandler: Oh, thats mature.
Chandler: Nothing, nothing.
Chandler: Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Chandler: (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Chandler: Uh-oh.
Chandler: She was not good. Not good.
Chandler: Uh-oh.
Chandler: Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
Chandler: Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have moreimportant things to worry about.
Chandler: (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, were never leaving,ever.
Chandler: Oh great, food with hair on it.
Chandler: Because that would be crazy?
Chandler: Yeah, come on, its Ross and Rachel, theyve got too.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Are you actually saying these words?
Chandler: Lets go.
Chandler: (to Joey) Is that your new walk?
Chandler: This is the New York Times.
Chandler: We are. Hes meeting us here.
Chandler: Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over toborrow something.
Chandler: Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced.Man, I hope Ross doesnt try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Chandler: Y'know what maybe its gonna be okay, I mean its been aweek.
Chandler: No.
Chandler: Yes, yes, its just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made planswith Ross.
Chandler: Yeah, hes really excited about it too, he even recorded showtimes on his answering machine.
Chandler: (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!
Chandler: Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, Im,Im smoking still.
Chandler: Look, Im telling you this is just like my parents divorce, whichis when I started smoking in the first place.
Chandler: Yeahhh. Im tellin ya something, that ah, first smoke afternap time....
Chandler: Oh thats great, with my luck, thats gonna be him.
Chandler: Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents gotdivorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door andits Rachel again.)
Chandler: Hey, shut up!! Youre not my real Mom!!
Chandler: Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Chandler: Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Chandler: (to Joey) Well hes probably mad after you called him thismorning to borrow his goggles.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Beam me up Jesus.
Chandler: Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
Chandler: Oh, come on, theres a rest stop right up there! Come on, Ireally have to goooooooooo.

Chandler: Damn! (stands up) The tailpipes not hot enough to light this!
Chandler: Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I putit on this morning.
Chandler: Ladies, ladies, lets just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel takeoff Monicas bra.
Chandler: Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by andsave us.
Chandler: Okay, now lets decide who has the nicest ass.
Chandler: At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Chandler: I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light anothercigarette.)
Chandler: Well its very unsettling.
Chandler: Oh no, now its not gonna make any sense!
Chandler: Oh, this is horrible, its just horrible.
Chandler: Its horrible.
Chandler: Y'know what, I can handle it, handles my middle name. Actuallyits the ah, middle part of my first name.

Chandler: I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Chandler: Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: No-no, why dont you hang on to that one.
Chandler: Okay, thats like the least fun game ever.
Chandler: Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smokingpatch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fakelaughs.)
Chandler: Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Chandler: Y'know, I wouldve bet good money that hed be the first oneof us to get married.
Chandler: Always illegal Joe.
Chandler: If that doesnt keep kids in school, what will?
Chandler: (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.
Chandler: Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I justcarry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Chandler: Y'know what, pretty good.
Chandler: Good! I havent smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-andconfident, that is a stunning blouse.
Chandler: Thanks
Chandler: What check thing?
Chandler: (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete (quickly grabs a magazineand opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?
Chandler: Whos he huggin?
Chandler: This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses thatprogram!
Chandler: There you go!!
Chandler: (to the girls who are staring at him) What?
Chandler: (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)
Chandler: Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe himanything.
Chandler: Okay, then get the lobster!
Chandler: Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife soldseparately.
Chandler: Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Chandler: Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Chandler: Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythmis going to get you.
Chandler: Its possible. You are very loveable, Id miss you if Ibroke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.
Chandler: (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, Id miss you.
Chandler: And youre our age. Youre our age.
Chandler: Thats not a state Joe.
Chandler: Youre our age!
Chandler: I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesnt matter, Istill wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thingon the middle part of my head. Its so annoying. Does it bug you?
Chandler: Is there any chance you didnt see that?
Chandler: Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through thepeep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye!
Chandler: You didnt just break up.
Chandler: You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. Imean bullets have left guns slower!
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Chandler: Stop what?!
Chandler: No!! You cant!! 
Chandler: I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!(Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisinglystrong!
Chandler: Look man!
Chandler: Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds thedoor shut with his feet.) 
Chandler: Shes moving on! Okay, if its not this guy, its gonnabe somebody else! And unless youre thinking about subletting my peep hole, youare going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man?Its over.
Chandler: Okay. 
Chandler: I know. (He rubs Rosss head) 
Chandler: I dont think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.(He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like agunfighter in a Western.) 
Chandler: (to Joey) I wasnt doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwinghis stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Chandler: Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Chandler: I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Chandler: Im talking about you. You big, big freak.
Chandler: Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If youwere in a school yard youd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Chandler: Cause its-its not his last name.
Chandler: No, its not like, like Phil Spiderman. Hes a spider, man.Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but theres no Gold Man.
Chandler: So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Chandler: What about things that are already gold?
Chandler: Okay, lets play my game now.
Chandler: Wait a minute, wait. Youre telling me this actress person is theonly woman you ever wanted who didnt want you back?!
Chandler: My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Oh, thats-thats okay, no problem. (He starts to lookaround her office.)
Chandler: Yes, I realise that.
Chandler: Thats the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
Chandler: Thanks, its ah, Gaelic, for Thy turkeys done.So ah, Im gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Chandler: Hello.
Chandler: (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
Chandler: Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Chandler: Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkinout the Chan-Chan man!
Chandler: Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. Ill do it.
Chandler: (entering) Hey, my Fathers house does that!
Chandler: Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothinglike a cool, crisp New York evening. 
Chandler: Of course, I didnt get to enjoy any of that, becauseJoannas such a big, dull dud!
Chandler: (entering with Rachel) Im telling ya, Joannas got it allwrong. Okay? All I said was, This was fun. Lets do it again sometime.Ill give you a call.
Chandler: Thats what you say at the end of a date.
Chandler: To her face? Look its the end of the date, Im standingthere, I know all shes waiting for is for me to say Ill call herand its just y'know, comes out. I cant help it, its a compulsion.
Chandler: Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Chandler: (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.
Chandler: Look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say,In case you didnt notice, I dont like you!
Chandler: Nooo!! Shes really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goopthing in the corner of her eye!
Chandler: All right! Fine! But its just a lunch date, no more than anhour! And from now on I get my own dates, I dont want you setting me up with anybodyever again!
Chandler: Thats just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Chandler: Its not a big deal. Its, just its right here,(points to his eye) and its all the time.
Chandler: (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this waspleasant.
Chandler: The food there was, was great.
Chandler: So take care.
Chandler: Well, this was great. Ill give you a call. We should do it againsometime. (Rachel is disappointed) 
Chandler: Noo! 
Chandler: Look, Im sorry. Okay? Im weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Chandler: AhhhhIm not going to call you.
Chandler: Im sorry. Im-Im-Im sorry that I said I wasgoing to when Im not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And thisisnt Rachels fault. Its me. I have serious, serious problems when itcomes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. AndIm really sorry, its just that this is not, this isnt going to work out.
Chandler: Yeah, o-okay.
Chandler: Well this is great! Ill give you a call! We should do it againsometime!
Chandler: (sporting a goatee) Hey.
Chandler: Oh, so thats why the priest threw holy water on me.(theres no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? Youshould come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around herecrying all day about Kate.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: No way!
Chandler: Oh my God! Whos gonna watch that?!
Chandler: Yeah. (they start to leave)
Chandler: Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
Chandler: So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it takefor the roller skating thing to happen.
Chandler: Okay, so I guess thats about ah, two weeks before the toplessthing kicks in.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Okay. (He opens it and its a baby chick) Its a chicken.
Chandler: Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Chandler: Easy Lenny.
Chandler: Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here,and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joeyenters)-chickeeeen.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: She?
Chandler: I dont know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying todetermine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I cant tell, what ever it was wentback in too quickly.
Chandler: Excuse me?
Chandler: I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebodycould be here with our chick!
Chandler: You dont think I get up when you get up?
Chandler: Yes, here it comes! Im stuck here all day, and then you come inand spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?Well I dont think so mister!
Chandler: And you dont think taking care of our chick is work?
Chandler: I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got thischick, weve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
Chandler: Ill take her back tomorrow.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick outof a VCR?!
Chandler: I know. See, yes. Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completelydifferent kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took herto the shelter, and you know what I found out? 
Chandler: If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Imnot gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Chandler: Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds ofother animals!
Chandler: Thanks, Im glad you see it that way.
Chandler: Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
Chandler: Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
Chandler: Thats a bad duck!!! (to Ross) Howd the thing go tonight,Ross?
Chandler: (to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that,that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)
Chandler: (coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you do?
Chandler: Having a swim.
Chandler: Chicks dont swim.
Chandler: I dont know. Should we try it?
Chandler: See, I told you they dont swim. (He goes to take it out)
Chandler: Noo! (takes him out) Oh, its okay, its okay, baby, baby,baby.
Chandler: Ye-e-es!!
Chandler: Whos number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workersplay.
Chandler: Bye!
Chandler: Yeah, and I dont have any cologne.
Chandler: Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Chandler: (entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and achick to the theatre? 
Chandler: Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
Chandler: (seeing Joey) There he is!
Chandler: Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Chandler: I know.
Chandler: So thats the girl you like.
Chandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, you dont like the guyRachels dating? Well, thats odd.
Chandler: Could I borrow it?
Chandler: Oh-ho-ho-ho. 
Chandler: 7:15. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesnt work.
Chandler: Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he juststarted like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!
Chandler: Ross, dont. Ross!
Chandler: Ohh, thats a good one.
Chandler: Why dont you use ours across the hall, causeshehasproblems.
Chandler: Step away from the duck.
Chandler: And yet, shes still not hanging up the phone.
Chandler: Or... Dick.
Chandler: Was it like a sneeze only better?
Chandler: No!!
Chandler: Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.
Chandler: No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just gosee a 
Chandler: Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up toan even hundred. 
Chandler: You're right, I know.
Chandler: (joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Chandler: Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in therewith my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I meannot as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Chandler: Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should waterhis plants. If y'know what I mean.
Chandler: Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Chandler: (sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.
Chandler: So, what do you thing the good news is?
Chandler: Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? Hes not like other people, on yourfirst date he took you to Rome. For most guys thats like a third or fourth datekinda thing.
Chandler: Oh, so youre going with the teacher, huh?
Chandler: (comforting the duck) Everythings gonna be all right. Okay,Dick?
Chandler: Do you think that theres a town in Missouri or some place calledSample? And ah, as youre driving into town theres-theres like a sign,and it says Youre in Sample. (He says it like urine sample.)
Chandler: Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are:Theyre are no rules.
Chandler: Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody back to myoffice.
Chandler: Oh its Bing, sir. Im sorry , I was just ah...
Chandler: All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)
Chandler: Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting likeit was no big deal.
Chandler: Well, I didnt do anything. I didnt want to be the guy whohas a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Chandler: Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your headin between em.
Chandler: (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?
Chandler: (to his co-workers) What is with him?
Chandler: Well, thats not true, he-he smacked you once.
Chandler: No sir.
Chandler: (joining them) Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
Chandler: Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, its gonna beokay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes asplanned, my butt will be smack free.
Chandler: Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!
Chandler: No, I ah, I didnt do them.
Chandler: No, no I just ah, didnt do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with acouple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly dont deserve any praise,verbal or otherwise.
Chandler: Doug!!
Chandler: Im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you expressyourself.
Chandler: No, no. It-its not about the swearing, its more about ah,the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Chandler: Oh, and dont get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. Itsjust that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making allthe other guys jealous.
Chandler: Okay. (he starts to leave)
Chandler: Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)
Chandler: Thank you, sir.
Chandler: No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous.
Chandler: Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Chandler: Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Chandler: (to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Chandler: Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.
Chandler: (reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation1965.
Chandler: Youre not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Chandler: Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, Ill be your boyfriend.
Chandler: Why is that so funny?
Chandler: Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Chandler: Okay, so weve established my name, and hit me. But theoreticallyy'know, I mean say we werent friends, say its a blind date. I show up at yourdoor, and Im like (in a fake voice) Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They didexperiments on me! I cant have children!!
Chandler: Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Chandler: Big bullies!!
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Bored and bored!
Chandler: Yes!
Chandler: Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Chandler: So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material?
Chandler: I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Chandler: Yeah, well, lucky for you.
Chandler: I dont know.
Chandler: Oh, yeah, I dont know what they were doing, but at one point seaturtles actually came up to the house.
Chandler: Where ya going?
Chandler: (to Joey) Noo!! I dont care! Im not, Im not gonnaplaying one-on-one strip poker with you for practice! 
Joey and Chandler: Gnight.
Chandler: Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You dont need thatkindve hurt. Take it from a guy whos never had a long term relationship......
Chandler: Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)
Chandler: Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&amp;M.
Chandler: There is not one hair on that head.
Chandler: (in a fake voice) Hi there.
Chandler: Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, youre gonna wanna date thisnext guy, I swear!
Chandler: Hi! Im Dorf! Youre date for the evening. (Monica walksaway in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, thats good stuff!!
Chandler: (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head awayin disgust)
Chandler: (jumping up) Oh, Ill go out and get you some.
Chandler: Nope! Because Im not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, whosentering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Chandler: I found a dried up seashores.
Chandler: All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man onEarth. Would you go out with me?
Chandler: Ive got canned goods.
Chandler: Excellent hole, Joe.
Chandler: Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Chandler: Weve got to do something!
Chandler: Y'know what, hes right. Theres something like uh, ammoniain that, that like kills the pain.
Chandler: Me too!!
Chandler: Oh my God! If you say that one more time, Im gonna breakup with you!
Chandler: Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel. Ifyou bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Chandler: (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Chandler: Ill give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Chandler: (running over and joining Monica) Theyll never understand!
Chandler: (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone.We didnt think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monicasshoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
Chandler: And then Joey remembered something.
Chandler: (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, Do itnow! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here thescreaming.
Chandler: (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
Chandler: I KNEW IT!!!!
Chandler: We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play thisgame naked.
Chandler: Okay. All right.
Chandler: Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
Chandler: You dont turn and slide, you throw it out! Im tired ofhaving to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Chandler: All right, how about we, how bout we sell it.
Chandler: (nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (toJoey) They seem all right with it!
Chandler: Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all theland.
Chandler: (reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fineItalian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)
Chandler: You want it?
Chandler: Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Chandler: All right look, Im changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Chandler: (looks at him) Nooo.
Chandler: I cant believe you dont know what I do for a living!
Chandler: (interrupting) Let it go!!
Chandler: Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, noteveryone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Chandler: Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
Chandler: Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.
Chandler: All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when youget home, throw the canoe away!
Chandler: Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.
Chandler: Oh-no, hes right.
Chandler: Im coming already!!
Chandler: OH MY GOD!!!
Chandler: Are you all right?!
Chandler: (lets him out) What happened?!!
Chandler: What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hellis all of our stuff?!!
Chandler: SoYou got in voluntarily?!
Chandler: BEND OVER?!!!
Chandler: Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Chandler: Oh, they said uh, You dont have insurance here, so stopcalling us.
Chandler: Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, wed really appreciateit. (Joey nods in agreement)
Chandler: Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Chandler: Could we be more white trash?
Chandler: Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on thestreet yesterday.
Chandler: Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get adrink.
Chandler: (laughs) No. No!
Chandler: Well, not at first.
Chandler: Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time wewere able to take the relationship to the next level.
Chandler: Oh, come on! Its not like this is an everydayoccurrence for me! I mean usually Im pretty much just in there by myself.
Chandler: Okay, I promise, Ill end it.
Chandler: it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh,but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)
Chandler: It just doesntfeel like were breaking up.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Thanks.
Chandler: Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)
Chandler: When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Chandler: Ah-ha, youre not the boss of me. (She kisses him)Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.
Chandler: You are, youre gonna leave me like this?
Chandler: Okay. But if you dont come back soon, (She leaves andcloses the door) theres pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Chandler: Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?
Chandler: Hello, Joanna(Realises he doesnt know her lastname)s office.
Chandler: How little?!
Chandler: Look, this isnt funny! You get back here right now!
Chandler: Why not?!
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see youfor a moment?
Chandler: Okay, heres the situation. The keys to the cuffs areon the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlockme? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
Chandler: I did break up with her! She just took it really, reallywell!
Chandler: It did enter my mind! But then something happened that madeit, shoot right out.
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I cant get myself right out ofthem! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlockme, she could be gone for hours, and Im cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on astatue behind Joannas desk.)
Chandler: Never!
Chandler: Fine!
Chandler: Inever borrowed your Walkman.
Chandler: You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goesover and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)
Chandler: No, I just always see guys doing this when they gethandcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!
Chandler: About what?
Chandler: Ill make something up! Im good at lying, Iactually did borrow your Walkman!
Chandler: Oh-ho-ho, I dont think so!
Chandler: Well, this is much better.
Chandler: Hey, look, youre in trouble either way! Okay? If shecomes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, shes gonna know you werein here. So you might as well just let me go.
Chandler: It still wouldnt be clean. (Rachel makes an Eww,disgusting! face) All I want is my freedom.
Chandler: Freedom!
Chandler: Freedom! I want my freedom! Why wont you here me?!(Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)
Chandler: Im gonna say this for the last time. Would you pleasejust (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head,which proves his point.)
Chandler: No!
Chandler: With extra pulp?
Chandler: No!
Chandler: You dont have it.
Chandler: How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Chandler: (intrigued) Go on.
Chandler: And Milton Berle has a
Chandler: (hello) Hello.
Chandler: (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)
Chandler: (checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!
Chandler: I think so.
Chandler: Could there be more Kims?
Chandler: Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather justdoesnt say cool anymore.
Chandler: Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ivemissed the last 1200 times.
Chandler: You dont think Ive tried? You think I like having50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way downthere! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then theybring out Maria.
Chandler: Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycraspandex covered gymtreat.
Chandler: No!
Chandler: Oh no, youll have to come.
Chandler: Why dont you just give him to somebody else?
Chandler: Because thats the only part of you he can see when hes onthe table!
Chandler: Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!
Chandler: No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Chandler: Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.
Chandler: I wanna quit the gym.
Chandler: (He turns to Ross and Ross makes a Be strong sound.) Iwanna quit the gym.
Chandler: (horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure abouthimself) I wanna quit the gym.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: No, I almost did, couldnt leave Ross there without a spotter!
Chandler: Were doomed. Okay, theyre gonna take 50 bucks out of ouraccounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Chandler: Youre a genius!
Chandler: Now, theres two reasons.
Chandler: Thank you, Joey.
Chandler: Hi.
Chandler: No, wed just like to close them.
Chandler: I wanna quit the bank!
Chandler: To pay for the gym.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Yeah Bunny-rabbit.
Chandler: Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Chandler: I could die.
Chandler: I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Chandler: Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)
Chandler: All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Chandler: (gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.
Chandler: Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sittingover there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Chandler: Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Chandler: Oh-oh-hey!
Chandler: Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Chandler: Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)
Chandler: Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate howI could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Chandler: (sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!
Chandler: Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight overthe remote.
Chandler: Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Chandler: Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would'veknown you guys were... I never would've...
Chandler: So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Chandler: That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearsewith him.
Chandler: Is it on?
Chandler: Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)
Chandler: Oh! It's on! It's on!
Chandler: There we go little fella.
Chandler: Well the duck can swim.
Chandler: Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Chandler: She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, shesaid the funniest thing about--what? 
Chandler: No, I don't.
Chandler: Thank you, Ross.
Chandler: All right.
Chandler: All right.
Chandler: Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keepsrunning, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts toplay. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by ahot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs,in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes thechase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries toget up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets outof the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple ofcabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.
Chandler: Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Chandler: Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)
Chandler: (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Chandler: I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know?I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (hewaits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love youChandler!
Chandler: Really?!
Chandler: (laughs) Right in there!
Chandler: 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees thatthe chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over theconcept one more time.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
Chandler: Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get mestraight through the week.
Chandler: You-you do?
Chandler: You got me.
Chandler: Yeah. Right.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Chandler: Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know?Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnetstockings.
Chandler: Uhh, no-no thanks.
Chandler: Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Hey, look, what do you want from me?
Chandler: I am pretending.
Chandler: Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?(Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinkingabout her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'mso fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for everyminute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met herfirst!!
Chandler: Can I sleep on your couch?
Chandler: Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world. 
Chandler: Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back ofChandler's head) How did you get a girl like that? 
Chandler: Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era. 
Chandler: Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper? 
Chandler: Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago. 
Chandler: Well, I have a call in about that. 
Chandler: Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of herfavorite book. 
Chandler: Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils. 
Chandler: Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talkedto a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren. 
Chandler: It doesn't say that. Does it? 
Chandler: Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her somethingreally great. 
Chandler: It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into thebathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday? 
Chandler: (confused) Sure... 
Chandler: I don't know... um, Grease? 
Chandler: Rent? 
Chandler: Okay, so when do you want to go? 
Chandler: Yes, it is, at Office Max. 
Chandler: A pen.
Chandler: Huh-huh! You can't give her that. 
Chandler: Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah! 
Chandler: All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delvecciofor her birthday? 
Chandler: For three years? 
Chandler: All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay? 
Chandler: Would you like me to write her a little poem as well? 
Chandler: Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a presentfor Kathy that would be better than the rabbit. 
Chandler: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible thingsfor Kathy." (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me ahand with all this stuff? 
Chandler: She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want herto have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her. 
Chandler: Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic? 
Chandler: Where? 
Chandler: I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next tohis ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book! 
Chandler: No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the VelveteenRabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likesit, okay? 
Chandler: No, it came out to an even twenty. 
Chandler: Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift? 
Chandler: Oh yeah? That's great! 
Chandler: [nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh.... 
Chandler: Hey! Happy birthday. 
Chandler: No he didn't. [Moving it back.] 
Chandler: Happy birthday! I'm sorry. 
Chandler: See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also aclock. 
Chandler: Oh, yeah... yeah. 
Chandler: [to Kathy] Goodnight. 
Chandler: Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you...you don't always know the exact time. 
Chandler: Uh, the book? 
Chandler: What do you mean? 
Chandler: (tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that soundwas, "Uhl, ell." 
Chandler: Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend. 
Chandler: Goodnight. (Goes to his room.) 
Chandler: (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathynaked! It was like torture!
Chandler: It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean its badenough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I thinkshe knows. Because every time were in the room together theres this weird likeenergy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seenher naked. I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine herbody was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, shes smooth!Smooth! (leaves)
Chandler: (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Chandler: Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) Sothings didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Chandler: (shocked) What?
Chandler: Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
Chandler: Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endlessline of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He cant believe he justsad that.)
Chandler: Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. ButCasey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense thatshes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
Chandler: All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know?Make a choice, pick a lane.
Chandler: All right! Bring it on, you
Chandler: (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!
Chandler: Really, bitchin!
Chandler: You mean like, music?
Chandler: Yeah, I know what youre thinkin! Yes, yes, your breastsare just as firm and juicy.
Chandler: Come in!
Chandler: Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Chandler: No-no, hes not back yet, but hell be here any minute. Souh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
Chandler: I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) of theboat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.
Chandler: What happened?
Chandler: Why cant you tell her?
Chandler: Joey! Joey!!
Chandler: I thought your time ran out.
Chandler: (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. Hes running a little late, hesays hes sorry.
Chandler: So I guess its just uh, you and me then.
Chandler: Yeah, I think it is!
Chandler: Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut
Chandler: and then it got canceled.
Chandler: Really?! You do that?
Chandler: Dog grooming huh? Okay, just dont make my tail too poofy.
Chandler: Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers throughhis hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Yknow who also hasgreat hair is Joey!
Chandler: What-what cha doin?
Chandler: Kay.
Chandler: (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phones makingsounds! (On phone) Hello!
Chandler: Hey its Joey!
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)
Chandler: Yeah. Yes! Yeah. 
Chandler: Oh. 
Chandler: No-no-no-no, this is bad! Its bad! This is bad!
Chandler: Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: Ooh! Yes! Okay! Heres what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Chandler: Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means were unhappyforever. Sound good?
Chandler: I have to; hes my best friend, and youre seeing him.
Chandler: (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Dont! Dont! See-see,youre getting me confused, Im starting to urn. 
Chandler: I-I think we have too.
Chandler: Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up againstthe door.) Are you still out there?
Chandler: Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it toreveal a fully furnished apartment.)
Chandler: I sure did.
Chandler: Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nicefor my friend.
Chandler: Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over andpresses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealingthe TV.)
Chandler: Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Chandler: Oh, I dont know.
Chandler: You mean with Casey.
Chandler: Or Casey.
Chandler: Could be Casey.
Chandler: Consider Casey.
Chandler: That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Chandler: I kissed Kathy.
Chandler: No. Is there anyway, anyway you think hellunderstand this?
Chandler: Oh, dont say that! Dont say that. Thats not true. Isit?
Chandler: Then why didnt you tell me to do that?!!
Chandler: God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!
Chandler: Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Chandler: Yeah, I know.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Is that a real thing?
Chandler: Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Chandler: Its-its about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lotactually.
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Oh uh, when?
Chandler: Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Chandler: Yes, but I-I uh, dont have too.
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
Chandler: See uh, thats-thats actually what I wanted to talk to youabout. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Chandler: Its me. Im the other guy.
Chandler: Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got totalking, and one thing to another and
Chandler: No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Chandler: How is that worse?!
Chandler: Look, Im sorry! But theres nothing I can do, I thinkIm in love with her!
Chandler: Youre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Chandler: Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Chandler: Probably because
Chandler: (on phone) Hey, its me. I know you cant stand to be in thesame room as me, so I just thought Id try and apologize over the phone. All I(Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)
Chandler: Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but Im(Joey hangs up the phone again.)
Chandler: (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Chandler: They couldnt be worse. I spent eight hours calling him lastnight, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Chandler: Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa,cause I wanna trade for her.
Chandler: Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Chandler: Oh thats not true! Thats not true! I got her that backpackand she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran offwith it (notices the look on Monica and Phoebes faces.) Oh, there was no bigdog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put onit (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials
Chandler: Op, y'know what though, its kindve a girlie briefcase.
Chandler: Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Chandler: Thanks.
Chandler: Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Chandler: Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Chandler: Hes really picky about his patients.
Chandler: (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress withJoey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammedthe door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
Chandler: Oh yknow what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Chandler: I dont know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for youroffice.
Chandler: Oh no-no-no, you dont want to do that, then youre gonnaget stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Chandler: Like?
Chandler: When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Chandler: Big dog?
Chandler: I walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumblessomething in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Chandler: Hey Joe.
Chandler: Hey! Im sorry! That(sees that Joey is about to leave)where are you going?
Chandler: Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say thatIll stop seeing her?
Chandler: Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Chandler: All right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at leaststay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with therobbery and all!
Chandler: What?
Chandler: All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to besomething that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get init for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?
Chandler: (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really badidea to me.
Chandler: The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up throughthe air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up anotherfinger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up athird finger), it hurts!
Chandler: Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)
Chandler: How do ya do.
Chandler: What happened? What happened?!
Chandler: Gotcha! (laughs)
Chandler: Sorry!
Chandler: Okay, okay, you got it!

Chandler: Youre right, and Im sorry! This means a lot to me! I wantyou to be my friend again! I swear, I wont say another word tonight.
Chandler: Absolutely!
Chandler: So?

Chandler: Well, those were seals, man.
Chandler: Yeah, all right.
Chandler: Actually, me too.
Chandler: Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think Istrained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?

Chandler: Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Chandler: Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Chandler: How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at theyall look at him) That joke wouldve killed in Albany.
Chandler: Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) Theyre lighting the bigChristmas tree tonight.
Chandler: All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I reallywanted to take Kathy to this, I cant believe I missed it.
Chandler: Really?! I didnt think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Chandler: Yknow what? Theres some nice guys at my office, do youwant me to set you up?
Chandler: Well, I have a girlfriend, Im-Im happy. So, I no longerfeel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Chandler: Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Chandler: Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just sohe could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whos boss.
Chandler: (he glares at him for a while) Yes.
Chandler: I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him)Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Imnot gay, Im not asking you out. Im not-Im not-Im not gay!

Chandler: Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Chandler: Oh, it doesnt matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey,yknow what, Ive got two tickets to tonights Rangers game, you wanna comewith me?
Chandler: Well, actually its a hockey team, so its angry Canadianswith no teeth.
Chandler: Have you ever been with a woman?
Chandler: So there is no good time to ask that question.
Chandler: I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Chandler: Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Chandler: Well, you-you know what I meant.
Chandler: So what job did you get Joe?
Chandler: Youre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony PlayStation?
Chandler: Oh, yeah, sure, its not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Chandler: Yes. Right where?
Chandler: Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Chandler: All right, we havent had sex yet. Okay, whats the bigdeal? Yknow? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to thenext level.
Chandler: No, hes right, Im totally lying.
Chandler: Well, Kathys last boyfriend was Joey.
Chandler: No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.
Chandler: Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Chandler: We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likesto agree with him a lot.
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. ButIm just doing it for you guys.
Chandler: Hi.
Chandler: Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Chandler: Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Chandler: It was fine, yknow? But she didnt agree with me asstrongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, Im allright with it."
Chandler: Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with awoman, yknow, I know where everything goes, its always nice. But I need toknow what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebodys killing her inthere!"
Chandler: Look, you dont have to draw an actual wowhoa! Sheshot!
Chandler: (shocked) There are seven?!
Chandler: (Points to one) Thats one?
Chandler: Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
Chandler: That-thats bad?
Chandler: Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Chandler: You!
Chandler: Well the vet seems to think thats shes becoming a rooster.(The rooster crows.) Were getting a second opinion.
Chandler: Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Chandler: I can check that for ya.
Chandler: Well we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in evennumbers.
Chandler: (to Rachel) And you Ross, I believe, if you check Rachelsbag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Chandler: Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Chandler: (to Ross) Stop that now!
Chandler: Yes!
Chandler: Diet soda.

Chandler: Althea?! What are you doing?! 
Chandler: You're shooting with Althea?!
Chandler: Nice shooting!
Chandler: Actually, its Miss Chinandolor Bong.
Chandler: Unfortunately that is correct.
Chandler: I majored in lightning rounds. All right, were gonna destroyyou.
Chandler: Well, Im so confused as to what weve been doing sofar
Chandler: Say 200?
Chandler: (interrupting) All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Chandler: But if we win, we get your apartment.
Chandler: Okay. (Starts jumping around.)
Chandler: Dangerous Liaisons.
Chandler: Oh! (Whispers something in Joeys ear and then in Rosssear.)
Chandler: Fancy.
Chandler: Fancy guest.
Chandler: Thanks man.
Chandler: You cant just call Monicas room.
Chandler: Oh, I would never bet this apartment. Its too nice.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Yeah, but I bet it works.
Chandler: Well believe it baby!
Chandler: I knew it!
Chandler: Cool, girl roommate.
Chandler: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining movingday for us!
Chandler: What?! What-what is it?!
Chandler: I cant believe we live here!
Chandler: Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! Iget to have sex with the star of the play!
Chandler: I know!!
Chandler: Wow! She looks great. Doesnt she?
Chandler: Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Chandler: Yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worstnightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Chandler: Im totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy onstage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hesgonna try to undermine me. Y'know itll be like, "So wheres yourboyfriend, whats-his-name, Chester?" And shell go, "No-no-no,its Chandler." And hell go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Chandler: All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Chandler: Yeah, I know but
Chandler: Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals,muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which Im fairly certainare the same thing.
Chandler: Im right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them.Before they had heat, and now theres no heat! Now you know what this means, Joeytold us what this means!
Chandler: Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Chandler: Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearlyyoure having sex with him.
Chandler: Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Chandler: Yknow, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know youreup there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing.
Chandler: Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Chandler: Well, that is what happened, and I dont even see you denyingthis!
Chandler: Yeah, well, dont expect that to happen anytime soon!
Chandler: Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking atthe new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behindtheir backs. Chandler wonders into the girls apartment.) You will all be very happyto hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Chandler: I confronted her, and she didnt deny it! (Pause) I dontlive here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)
Chandler: Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to BeefsteakJulies
Chandler: Yes! See you and I have always been like(motions that they thinkthe same.)
Chandler: Did she call?
Chandler: All right, maybe I should call her.
Chandler: Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Chandler: Well y'know, what if she didnt actually sleep with the guy?
Chandler: She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat.Back me up here, Ross!
Chandler: Thats not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage andthe heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Chandler: Oh my God!!
Chandler: Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that Im sorry.Yknow? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completelyunderstand why you were so upset.
Chandler: Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but yknow I-I think this is agood thing. Y'know? Cause weve had our first fight, and now we can move on.Yknow, I know for me(Notices a pair of mens pants on the chair.)Nicks pants?
Chandler: Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Chandler: Well, she wasnt sleeping with him.
Chandler: She is now.
Chandler: Im saying that she is a devil woman! Yknow I meanyou think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, withhis rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, Idont hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
Chandler: Because, I-I shouldve called! Yknow if I had just calledher after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldve gone out with Nick, and theywouldve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Chandler: You dont have to stop having fun just because Im here.Kathy didnt cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandlergoes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)
Chandler: (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Wouldyou give me one minute!! Please.
Chandler: Yknow, I cant believe Kathy did this too me. I really,thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on Im never getting out ofthis chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is theone? My sweat pants!
Chandler: Thats right! Where are the guys? Im ready to get drunk andsee some strippers.
Chandler: They got a breakfast buffet.
Chandler: Ooh, let me talk to him!
Chandler: Well, can I just
Chandler: Shes shhing me! Its my phone and shes shhing me!
Chandler: Ow!
Chandler: Maybe, she doesnt hit him all the time. 
Chandler: Okay, Im going to go stand over there. (Points and moves intothe living room.)
Chandler: So yknow, uh, whens he getting back?
Chandler: Yknow, I knew something like this was going to happen. (Hestarts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)
Chandler: Yes you can. Youre thinking about time, you cant go backin time.
Chandler: (laughs) No you cant.
Chandler: You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy andwouldnt live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)
Chandler: Okay. (Starts to cry)
Chandler: No thanks, Mom!
Chandler: Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Imjust gonna go home and call Kathy.
Chandler: No! That was a test! In a couple of hours Im gonna get reallydrunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that,Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice
Chandler: Ohhh!!
Chandler: Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitressthere is quitting to teach the third grade!
Chandler: All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on.
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: Stripping!
Chandler: Okay, look, Im gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Chandler: Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay?Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldnt picture myself with any of them.(Sits back in disgust.)
Chandler: (jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Chandler: I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Chandler: Well, Im there too!
Chandler: Stop it! Youre killing me! I think I just moved on to PhaseFour!
Chandler: Where I dont want to have a relationship ever! I just want tohave sex with strippers and my friends!!
Chandler: Come on, let me see that smile.
Chandler: Please?
Chandler: I know, I know, but youre gonna have plenty of chances. Thereare literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Chandler: All right ladies, heres what were gonna do. (Points to astripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two,go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of yourvoice, "Chandlers the king! Chandlers the king!"
Chandler: Oh, thats fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Chandler: Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at anymoment!
Chandler: What do you want from me, Ive never met the guy. So anyway,Rachel, Im sorry you cant stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy withthe cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guystarts rubbing Chandlers back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right,listen, Ive got to wake up!
Chandler: Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And yousaid it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is.  Also, you said there would beother guys here. There are no other guys here!
Chandler: Thats a mailman! Thats our mailman! (Waves to themailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?
Chandler: Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Chandler: (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!
Chandler: Isnt this amazing? 
Chandler: Okay. Bye.
Chandler: Bye.
Chandler: Bye.
Chandler: B-bye!
Chandler: Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After its closed) Icant stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)
Chandler: Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did beforewe fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityWell, theyre allback! Yknow? And shes picked up like nine new ones!
Chandler: Dont worry about it. Im taking care of it tonight.(Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
Chandler: (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I dont have to breakup with her this time. Were not involved! Im going to do a pre-emptive strike!Im going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes thefridge.) 
Chandler: Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people werecomplaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Chandler: (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a veryserious relationship
Chandler: Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Chandler: I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring meoverseas!
Chandler: No! No! Not, Paris. 
Chandler: Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen.Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!
Chandler: I dont know exactly.
Chandler: But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
Chandler: Yknow uh, you didnt really have to help me pack.
Chandler: Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Chandler: Oh, Im packing. Yknow Im-Im packingcause Im moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Chandler: Im only going to pretend Im moving to Yemen, its theonly way I can get rid off her.
Chandler: (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!
Chandler: (from his bedroom) Thanks!
Chandler: Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.
Chandler: Well, were really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess thisis uh, good-bye then.
Chandler: Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then. (Hands her the signthat says, Wait Here.") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Chandler: Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Chandler: What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Chandler: No. All right, yknow what, shes (Points to Janice) gonnathink that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is handyou a library card.

Chandler: Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Chandler: Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Chandler: Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. 
Chandler: No!
Chandler: Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, andalso-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Chandler: Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!(To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
Chandler: Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Chandler: What are you writing?
Chandler: Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me acall sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of stylewhat did you throw away?
Chandler: Hi guys!
Chandler: Without me?!
Chandler: Yes, but in Rosss case, they both know in two weeksthats it.
Chandler: Maybe thats because soy-burgers suck!
Chandler: What are you talking about?
Chandler: Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points tothe living room.)
Chandler: Like what?
Chandler: I said, "Like what?"
Chandler: Does for me.
Chandler: Flashdance.
Chandler: She was a welder.
Chandler: What are the odds? What are the odds?
Chandler: Okay. 
Chandler: Theres a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving thesandwich to Phoebe.)
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Oh-ho, yeah!
Chandler: Treegers snaking the shower drain.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Do we pay for this?
Chandler: Maybe we shouldnt pay our phone billfree phone sex.
Chandler: Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Chandler: Like finding money with naked people on it!
Joey and Chandler: (stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!
Chandler: We dont know what could make this go away.
Chandler: And no one touches the air around the TV!
Joey and Chandler: Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they tentatively lookbehind them)
Chandler: We still have porn.
Chandler: Or a job where you dont have to carry a table.
Chandler: Its the theme from Good Will Humping.
Chandler: Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue wascorny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Chandler: They dont really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can getyou some free white out though.
Chandler: Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
Chandler: All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her,its over.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Okay. (Pause) Good one.
Chandler: Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a pornbreak. We spent the last two hours watching In &amp; Out &amp; In, Again.
Chandler: Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Chandler: Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Chandler: Whats the second part of your plan?
Chandler: You put your fist through the wall?
Chandler: A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Chandler: Are we in London?
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and shedidnt ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Chandler: What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Chandler: Yknow what, we have to turn off the porn.
Chandler: All right, ready?

Chandler: Yeah, thats kinda a relief.
Chandler: You wanna see if we still have it?
Chandler: FREE PORN!!!
Chandler: We have free porn here!!!
Chandler: Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look likea drum.
Chandler: All right.
Chandler: Wouldnt that be Frank the III?
Chandler: Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Chandler: Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Chandler: Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youregonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesnt think so.) Oh,come on! Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you getto know him.
Chandler: Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be alittle late, but-but, hell be there. And hell bring you some cold soda, ifwant you need him for is that youre really hot.

Chandler: Its Clint! Clint!
Chandler: (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Chandler: All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going downto the courthouse.
Chandler: Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay,its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well withwomen So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson orJohn Markson.
Chandler: (pleased) Really?!
Chandler: Okay. Thanks.
Chandler: You wanna hug it out?

Chandler: And I love the milk! But, Im not gonna some British girl to movein with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.
Chandler: Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
Chandler: No thank you.
Chandler: Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but wecant leave in the small apartment after weve lived here! Didnt you everread Flowers for Algernon?
Chandler: Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lotmore than just season seats.
Chandler: Screw the Knicks!
Chandler: I didnt mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth somuch more.
Chandler: And the Knicks rule all.
Chandler: No. No. Were not gonna do that, yknow why? Because its notan even trade.

Chandler: What?
Chandler: Yeah, well, I dont dance at weddings.
Chandler: Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, Ilook like this (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behindhim and he stops.)
Chandler: Hey!

Chandler: But Ill tell you something. One of these days were get offof our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
Chandler: Uh-oh.
Chandler: She was not good. Not good.
Chandler: Uh-oh.
Chandler: (entering) Hello!
Chandler: (sarcastic) Noo.
Chandler: I didnt know that.
Chandler: See, maybe thats the one we shouldve actually hidden.
Chandler: This isnt one of those uh, yknow "If she doesntcome, we-we dont, we dont come?" Right? Because I already bought myticket

Chandler: You slept with the stripper?
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a littlesqueeze.)
Chandler: So you might say, its a magic ring.
Chandler: Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, whydont you be my best man."
Chandler: Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had hercome to my office?
Chandler: (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they allturn there backs on her.)
Chandler: Way to be cool, man.

Chandler: All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you?Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?
Chandler: How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
Chandler: Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Chandler: All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Chandler: Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. Iam not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower standand walks away trying to be cool.)
Chandler: Hey. (He nods at the hat.)
Chandler: No-no-no, yknow what? I really shouldnt have said that youwere embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnt cool. And if it makes you feel anybetter, Ive had a really lousy day.
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: Thats Thats was
Chandler: How did you? How? How?
Chandler: Im gonna go to the bathroom.
Chandler: That was pretty intense huh?

Chandler: Joey, its been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick,Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Chandler: Id like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will betomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will.(No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a longtime. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looksembarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he overinflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, DearGod.. (A cellular phone rings.)
Chandler: (Continuing his toast.) And Im sure were all very excitedthat Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friendgetting married in Monty Hall.

Chandler: Because hes crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked mefor my very moving performance in Titanic.
Chandler: Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldnt want you?
Chandler: (With the covers pulled up to his chin.) Morning, Ross.
Chandler: Yeah you are!!
Chandler: Well Ive-Ive never done that with you before.
Chandler: So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Chandler: Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You?(Looking over at her. She looks back.) We did you.
Chandler: Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Chandler: I dont want to look.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: (Very defensive.) Im not seeing Monica.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Oh my god!
Chandler: No!! Okay!! Whats with the third degree?! Why dont you justshine a light in my eyes?! (Joey looks totally confused.)
Chandler: Oh yea, your right. Its the second one.
Chandler: What we did last night was....
Chandler: Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.)
Chandler: Im coming over tonight though, right?
Chandler: It couldve been worse, he couldve shot her.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Oh wow, I hope you dont take this the wrong way but, I know wehad plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, Im just kinda worried about what it might doto our friendship.
Chandler: Seven times!
Chandler: In a foreign, romantic country
Chandler: Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
Chandler: Well, I dont see that we have a choice. But, when wereback home, we dont do it.
Chandler: Yknow, I saw a wine cellar downstairs
Chandler: Okay! 
Chandler: Forget it, thats off.
Chandler: The mans got a point.
Chandler: Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word,"Yippee!" just ignore me.
Chandler: Oh, hello Rachel.
Chandler: Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Chandler: Yeah, well be down in like five minutes.
Chandler: Oh, yay
Chandler: (To Monica) Hey, listen, why dont we go change in my room?
Chandler: Wow, you look
Chandler: Well, Ive got a girl in here.
Chandler: Well, were-were hanging out in here!
Chandler: Well, I suppose Id have to say you!! But, what if werewatching a movie in here?
Chandler: Well, Ross and Emily arent gonna use it.
Chandler: Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The roomexpects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didnt get sex. All of theother honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: Nope, not under here!
Chandler: Well, you couldnt have looked everywhere or else youwouldve found her!
Chandler: Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Chandler: Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)
Chandler: Yeah, were gonna go.
Chandler: Yeah, its a very large plane.
Chandler: But, well stay here with you.
Chandler: We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Chandler: We cant do that thats insane. I mean A hecould wake up and B yknow, lets go for it.
Chandler: Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something)Yknow, technically we still are over international waters.
Chandler: Kay!
Chandler: Uhh, no.
Chandler: No.
Chandler: Yes.
Chandler: Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: No we didnt!
Chandler: Yes! Good thing we have that, Not in New York rule.
Chandler: Right.
Chandler: Oh. Yknow, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasntbecause I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me cause,youre really hot! Is that okay?
Chandler: And Im cute too.
Chandler: Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.
Chandler: Bye. 
Chandler: (entering) Im still on London time, does that count?
Chandler: Oh, good! (They start kissing.)
Chandler: Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Chandler: I've had a very long, hard day.
Chandler: Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Chandler: For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Chandler: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me aboutchicken.
Chandler: Hey Joe!
Chandler: Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and aCoke-(Yelps in 
Chandler: Hey, Pheebs!
Chandler: Uh, The Wheatsheaf.

Chandler: I can't believe she can out run you man!
Chandler: Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Chandler: Oh that's not true.
Chandler: Okay, I gotta go to work.
Chandler: And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back. 
Chandler: Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Alwaysa pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)
Chandler: All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too muchhaven't we?
Chandler: I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Chandler: So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kissesher.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs herand kisses her.)
Chandler: Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Parkidea. (Gets up to leave.)
Chandler: I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Chandler: Hey, Pheebs!
Chandler: Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little Y'know, itdidn't have any It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that wewould all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Chandler: Atlantic City!
Chandler: Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Chandler: I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Chandler: Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachelevery time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Chandler: No.
Chandler: Okay. (They kiss again.)
Chandler: That's right.
Chandler: Oh no.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Hey! You okay?
Chandler: Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Chandler: All right
Chandler: Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month,they give you 2% financing.
Chandler: Really? Male nurses?
Chandler: So they're going on dates? When?
Chandler: This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is thatanother doctor?
Chandler: All right.
Chandler: (spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Chandler: Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already toldme, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we'regoofin' around.
Chandler: Fine! Maybe I will too!
Chandler: So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Chandler: Oh.
Chandler: Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.(Retreats in defeat.)
Chandler: (to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
Chandler: All right. Very good.
Chandler: Bye, momi-moo.
Chandler: Yes!
Chandler: Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
Chandler: Okay, keep saying it!
Chandler: So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Chandler: Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing aroundin the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends whocare a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to,y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Chandler: Really? Okay, so
Chandler: Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Chandler: Right!
Chandler: So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are theygonna name her?
Chandler: That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
Chandler: (entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monicais the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are allhere! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Chandler: Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Chandler: Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Chandler: Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Chandler: Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Chandler: Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?
Chandler: Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you luckydog!
Chandler: Yes!
Chandler: (entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Chandler: If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secretboyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Chandler: Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who hadlearned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (Hejumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)
Chandler: Yes!
Chandler: Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your bestfriends.
Chandler: That's true!
Chandler: That's true!
Chandler: Hey, there he is! There he is!
Chandler: How many times have I told you guys, you never watch thecooking channel!
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing upcaterpillars. 
Chandler: Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey'sgonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Chandler: Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the bestyou'd ever had.
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: What's your point?
Chandler: (entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there'ssomething you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Chandler: I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Whichwouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OHMYGOD.
Chandler: Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with meagain, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Chandler: Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts totake off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Chandler: Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Chandler: All right, let's show them how it's done.
Chandler: Y'know that wasn't part of it?
Chandler: Nope.
Chandler: (quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)
Chandler: Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)
Chandler: I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Chandler: Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have achef thing.
Chandler: Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)
Chandler: I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want peopleto think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Chandler: What's going on?
Chandler: Uh, hey!
Chandler: We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Chandler: Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)
Chandler: Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Chandler: Condoms?
Chandler: And condoms are the way to do that?
Chandler: (jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!
Chandler: Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Chandler: Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Chandler: (looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave usglasses!
Chandler: Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it'sfeed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)
Chandler: Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)
Chandler: Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Chandler: What? Why?
Chandler: Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)
Chandler: (turning to face her) Yeah.
Chandler: I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can youjust pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Chandler: (watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This isregularly scheduled programming!
Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Chandler: Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggageto 10 different rooms?
Chandler: Do not speak ill of the dead.
Chandler: I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez,relax mom.
Chandler: I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Chandler: Damn Rollos!
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, theentire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)
Chandler: Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Chandler: Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but thenmade everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Chandler: Monica. (Follows her out.)
Chandler: Okay, fine, $300.
Chandler: Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Chandler: Hi!
Chandler: Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Chandler: Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Yes that was mine.
Chandler: Yes that would have made more sense.
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: I just came over to drop offnothing. So that weekend kindasucked, huh?
Chandler: So, I guess this is over.
Chandler: Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Chandler: Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Chandler: So, this isn't over?
Chandler: Really? Okay. Great!
Chandler: (stops her) We're in a relationship?
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to dragJoey into Monica's room.)
Chandler: Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)
Chandler: It happened in London.
Chandler: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make abig deal out of it.
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Chandler: Fun's over!
Chandler: Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Chandler: Sorry.
Chandler: Hello!
Chandler: Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingersbloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.)That didn't happen, I made that up!
Chandler: Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Chandler: Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence
Chandler: You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. 
Chandler: So you're really okay with this?
Chandler: Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.We should get them together and make a continuum.
Chandler: Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
Chandler: So, rocks. 
Chandler: Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Chandler: Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would'vehappened.
Chandler: Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Chandler: Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animalrights thing?
Chandler: Uh, Ross?
Chandler: Yeah, we are so sorry.
Chandler: Hi!
Chandler: Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Chandler: Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
Chandler: That's a pig.
Chandler: Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
Chandler: What?! 
Chandler: How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Chandler: Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promiseme the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Chandler: He thought you said gonad.
Chandler: Love what you've done with the place.
Chandler: Oh yeah!
Chandler: Oh, the tears are real.
Chandler: What are you doing?
Chandler: You built a fort didn't ya?
Chandler: (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier!All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
Chandler: I hate this thing!
Chandler: (entering) Hello children!
Chandler: Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
Chandler: Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
Chandler: You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)
Chandler: (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this isRoss! I survived college with him!
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: No-no-no-no!
Chandler: Okay, so he's out of here.
Chandler: Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports?International? Apartment listings?
Chandler: Not even on page 7?
Chandler: What about that circled one?
Chandler: Yes, it is.
Chandler: There we go!
Chandler: Let's go quicker.
Chandler: Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great!Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Chandler: Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Chandler: It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Chandler: We are bad people.
Chandler: Yes that was a nice place!
Chandler: Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out thewindow in a bag!
Chandler: What are we gonna do?
Chandler: About Ross!
Chandler: (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh,barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tapdancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp!(Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello? 
Chandler: Ohhhhh!
Chandler: 98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Chandler: Here we go! Here we go!
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: You're kidding, no!
Chandler: Yeah!
Chandler: Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Chandler: All right, buddy!
Chandler: Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think thecowboy hat is a little much?
Chandler: All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on abonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
Chandler: That's sweet, Joey.
Chandler: Are you aware that you're still talking?
Chandler: No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't justswoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Chandler: It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay,moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Chandler: Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
Chandler: It's exactly like it sounds.
Chandler: Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in thedoorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)
Chandler: I'm over here big guy.
Chandler: (laughing) You did look like an idiot.
Chandler: Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is whatThanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Chandler: (seeing her) Okay.
Chandler: Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
Chandler: Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Chandler: Emotional Knapsack?
Chandler: Right on! Oh! Uh, but, dont take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we'regonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Chandler: Dude, don't do that too me!
Chandler: No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night withyour fat sister.
Chandler: I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Chandler: I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed thestage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Chandler: I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Chandler: We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Chandler: Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid weused to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
Chandler: Oh my God!
Chandler: You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Chandler: Sorry!
Chandler: Sorry.
Chandler: Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous macand cheese like last year.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Are you all right?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Chandler: That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Chandler: That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Chandler: Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (Hestorms out.)
Chandler: I can't believe this.
Chandler: Yeah, well, sorry doesnt bring back the little piggy that criedall the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see youlater.
Chandler: Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)
Chandler: Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" Im happy allthe time!
Chandler: Nice try.
Chandler: Look, Monica
Chandler: This is not going to work.
Chandler: You are so great! I love you!
Chandler: Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, Ijust stopped talking!
Chandler: No I didn't!
Chandler: No I didn't!
Chandler: No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Chandler: Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another butcan't) I'm out.
Chandler: Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Chandler: See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Chandler: Yeah!
Chandler: (interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.
Chandler: Well, yeah actually.
Chandler: I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Chandler: Help!
Chandler: Hi, Pheebs!
Chandler: I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Chandler: Well, what did the police say?
Chandler: Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Chandler: (reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller'slunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Chandler: Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is shesurrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Chandler: What is going on here?
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell themyou had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.
Chandler: OhI don't know.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: (gasps) You're naked in this picture!
Chandler: Ross?
Chandler: Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Chandler: And you're okay with that?
Chandler: (Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)
Chandler: All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Chandler: Joey's a sex addict. 
Chandler: Well let's.let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Chandler: Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Chandler: (Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.
Chandler: (Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross andJoey laugh silently.) Its been six months! Its not funny!
Chandler: Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!(Joey hangs up.)
Chandler: The British are coming?
Chandler: Ohh.
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
Chandler: Okay, I'll stop.
Chandler: You wanna play?
Chandler: Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he getshome.
Chandler: I'm intrigued. 
Chandler: Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security depositback.
Chandler: Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Chandler: (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing ovenmitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighterfluidOp! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)
Chandler: (entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Chandler: Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Chandler: (To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if herelaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Chandler: The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Chandler: Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Chandler: I paid for those tickets!
Chandler: Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
Chandler: When did that happen to you?!
Chandler: Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Chandler: Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!
Chandler: I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Chandler: Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go downthere and give them a project, ruin their day?
Chandler: Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!
Chandler: Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALLTHE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Chandler: All right. (Takes a copy.)
Chandler: What is up?
Chandler: No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Chandler: Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)
Chandler: (To Ross) I'm sorry too.
Chandler: I am sorry, Ross.
Chandler: This took you all day?!
Chandler: (deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.
Chandler: We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to soy'know
Chandler: (To Monica) Happy New Year!
Chandler: Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Chandler: That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find aplaneload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Chandler: I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" (Ross looks at him.) And itstarts right now!
Chandler: Nice!
Chandler: (reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Chandler: Horn-swoggle.
Chandler: No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sitsdown rubbing his temple.)
Chandler: What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some mightfind it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Chandler: (notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody elsesee that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on thepants!
Chandler: That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generallywear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybethere's something in that area.
Chandler: Oh come on!! (Storms out.)
Chandler: (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel isabsolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
Chandler: Oh my God!
Chandler: Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.
Chandler: (entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take itanymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs?Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your homeplanet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! AndHornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down andsighs in relief.)
Chandler: Sorry man.
Chandler: Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Chandler: Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Chandler: I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)
Chandler: I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this isMonica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Chandler: No, sir.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Oh, that was my work laugh.
Chandler: Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with onetoo.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night! 
Chandler: And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think yourepaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tenniswith them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time whenwe bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway,I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Chandler: Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Parkand hit rocks atbigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) HeyRach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Chandler: Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)
Chandler: Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Chandler: Let them win one.
Chandler: You're not even giving them a chance!
Chandler: Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?(Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!
Chandler: Oopsey, missed it!
Chandler: Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)
Chandler: Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashedracquet from his bag.)
Chandler: It was my racquet.
Chandler: If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrownight.
Chandler: Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
Chandler: Just a little bit of sugar.
Chandler: Oh, you get used to it.
Chandler: So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Chandler: Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Chandler: Well, I just
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.
Chandler: Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)
Chandler: (from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racistjokes now?!
Chandler: But we're not ready to tell yet!
Chandler: Man, she is really gullible.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Why would I be mad?
Chandler: (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But youknow what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! Theyforgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well,but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Chandler: I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Chandler: And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) sevendollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write itdownlet's write it down!
Chandler: Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Chandler: It's your timer.
Chandler: All right, then massage me up right nice!
Chandler: Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
Chandler: It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Chandler: Good-bye muscles!!
Chandler: I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was likeshe was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I justI didn't knowwhat it was!
Chandler: Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay,I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Chandler: (examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts lookingfor the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)
Chandler: And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Chandler: Done.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Chandler: Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Chandler: Oh my God!
Chandler: And a date with a man!
Chandler: (wincing) Yes, he is!
Chandler: I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
Chandler: Hey, is Rachel here?
Chandler: (coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about thisafternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Chandler: (falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.
Chandler: Okay, but now see you're crying!
Chandler: What?
Chandler: It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Chandler: Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Chandler: Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. Ifanybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves,"Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Chandler: Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Chandler: Absolutely!
Chandler: Yeah! (They hug.)
Chandler: Hey man, how did the audition go?
Chandler: Oh my God!
Chandler: Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)
Chandler: Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Chandler: And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Chandler: Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Chandler: (entering) Hello children!
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe gigglesuncontrollably.) Are you okay?
Chandler: Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Chandler: What's going on?
Chandler: Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually atiny little bunny.
Chandler: Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Chandler: The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I thinkPhoebe was hitting on me.
Chandler: I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Chandler: Ow!
Chandler: Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Chandler: No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched mybicep for crying out loud!
Chandler: Well it's not flexed right now!
Chandler: Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Chandler: That new mountain bike?
Chandler: Your work makes me sad.
Chandler: (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriateand the pinching!!
Chandler: Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Chandler: Are you serious?
Chandler: (a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and mybulging bicepsShe knows!
Chandler: (entering) Joey!
Chandler: Phoebe knows about us!
Chandler: Oh man!
Chandler: Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Chandler: Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding thephone so that Monica can hear it as well.)
Chandler: Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said Iwasn't intrigued.
Chandler: Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you comeover and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Chandler: Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
Chandler: (initially worried, but gets over it) Really?
Chandler: Yes.
Chandler: Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Chandler: How do you know?!
Chandler: At this?!
Chandler: Phoebe.
Chandler: Come on in.
Chandler: Sure.
Chandler: Me? No. You?
Chandler: So do I.
Chandler: I'm gonna put on some music.
Chandler: You look good.
Chandler: Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Chandler: Oh, do you not want to?
Chandler: (swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Chandler: Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to putlotion on her! 
Chandler: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a littlemimic of her dance.)
Chandler: Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
Chandler: Oh, you're-you're going?
Chandler: (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very weregonna be having all the sex.
Chandler: Not if I kiss you first.
Chandler: Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Chandler: Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Chandler: Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Chandler: Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (Theywalk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
Chandler: And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I sayyour breasts are still showing.
Chandler: Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Chandler: (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Fivemonths? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care,bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)
Chandler: Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Chandler: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Chandler: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in lovewith her.
Chandler: (interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Chandler: Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Chandler: Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl isbeating him up.
Chandler: (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.
Chandler: Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. Idon't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Chandler: Wh-wh-why?!
Chandler: Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Chandler: I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the onethat was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and thenthe new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?!Im right. I'm right. Am I right?
Chandler: Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Chandler: Hmm.
Chandler: Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)
Chandler: Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Chandler: I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl thatI'm seeing casually.
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Chandler: Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Chandler: Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage andeverything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turndown the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Chandler: Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in thehead--in your head!
Chandler: Well, I did not know that.
Chandler: It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is,this is fixable.
Chandler: By me?
Chandler: Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)
Chandler: Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
Chandler: Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me howto fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Chandler: Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Isshe here?
Chandler: I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Chandler: Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh,us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly andawkwardly gets down on one knee.)
Chandler: (getting out a ring box) Monica
Chandler: Will you marry me?
Chandler: I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Chandler: I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Chandler: No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty muchfourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.)Will you be my wife?
Chandler: Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Chandler: Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to theseguys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)
Chandler: I didn't think I was!
Chandler: Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend therest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped holein that door. (Points at the door.)
Chandler: Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Chandler: That's not funny.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, doyou know a six-letter word for red?
Chandler: Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here foryou later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?
Chandler: Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don'tserve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? Ithink I can come up with something better than that.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother wasshot by a hunter.
Chandler: Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You couldget arrested.
Chandler: Hi, Joe.
Chandler: Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Chandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had saidthat? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! Idont want to talk about it.
Chandler: You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!(To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.(Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) Ilove you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)
Chandler: No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealousbecause I've become the apartment stud.
Chandler: Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, areyou attracted to her?
Chandler: Well there you have it!
Chandler: Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we starteddating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Chandler: Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so
Chandler: (looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, reallyliked your new couch.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: (straining) Okay.
Chandler: Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Chandler: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Chandler: Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
Chandler: Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
Chandler: (stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Chandler: Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Chandler: (To Rachel) He has a gun!
Chandler: (entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Chandler: Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Chandler: So what happened?
Chandler: Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Chandler: Come on, Rach.
Chandler: I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizessomething, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her andkisses her.)
Chandler: (To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Chandler: Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you (He gestures and spillssome of his coffee.)
Chandler: Uh, yeah.
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: Ohh, so?
Chandler: Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It'scrazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to goupstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Chandler: That was amazing!
Chandler: That was amazing.
Chandler: No, you're the best.
Chandler: No, you're the best.
Chandler: Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Chandler: Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to thelining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee.(Heads for the bathroom.)
Chandler: Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?
Chandler: No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this isgetting ridiculous!
Chandler: Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are yougetting so obsessed about this thing?!
Chandler: (gasps) So?
Chandler: Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Chandler: Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth,I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Chandler: Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this longbefore. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, Ithink that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah Ithink that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about ourrelationship.
Chandler: Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Chandler: Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We haveswitched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrationalscrew up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.

Chandler: Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can youbring me back some of those polo shirts?
Chandler: Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.

Chandler: Yeah, it is the best.
Chandler: Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Chandler: Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
Ross and Chandler: Hi!
Chandler: Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Chandler: Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.

Chandler: Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Chandler: Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Chandler: I wish I had smoked for my career
Chandler: Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!

Chandler: Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Chandler: Awesome!

Chandler: Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert. 
Chandler: Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Chandler: Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot moreinteresting.
Chandler: Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go. 
Chandler: Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs camefirst.
Chandler: Okay, bye!
Chandler: What?
Chandler: I was not flirting.
Chandler: Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was notflirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Chandler: You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to movetowards Ross.)
Chandler: I was not flirting.
Chandler: I was not and oh God, shh!
Chandler: Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Chandler: So, Joey on Law &amp; Order, you must be very proud!
Chandler: I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She juststares at him.) I've done it again.
Chandler: Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)
Chandler: Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)
Chandler: The one that doesn't.

Chandler: Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Chandler: You're welcome.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.
Chandler: Really?!
Chandler: (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt withguys all the time?
Chandler: Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter thanI am.
Chandler: Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people.Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with otherwomen?
Chandler: (smiling) Well, what is it?
Chandler: (smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her outsoon?
Chandler: Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Chandler: So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law &amp; Order?
Chandler: See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like theLaw &amp; Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Chandler: Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things aredifferent for men and for women.
Chandler: Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See whenyou flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy isthinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Chandler: It's true.
Chandler: Again true.
Chandler: All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guysfrom the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Chandler: Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime itfor her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.
Chandler: Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)
Chandler: (To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have aproblem.
Chandler: Oh the humanity.
Chandler: More so than anything else.
Chandler: Almost over man.
Chandler: Why am I looking?
Chandler: You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Chandler: (singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencingcountdownengineson!
Chandler: (To Monica) Hey!
Chandler: You ready?
Chandler: You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Chandler: Let me see the earrings.
Chandler: (looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the besttaste or what?
Chandler: (To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Chandler: Hey man, what's up?
Chandler: Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: Well, I like danger.
Chandler: Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Chandler: It is starting to get dark out there.
Chandler: (laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.
Chandler: Your tax dollars?
Chandler: (leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwichreally does smell good.
Chandler: I can't smell your sandwich?
Chandler: Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joeyjust glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Chandler: How do you figure that?
Chandler: Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Chandler: Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Chandler: Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Chandler: (deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Chandler: What's going on?
Chandler: Uh, HELLO!!
Chandler: (pouting) It was a car backfire!
Chandler: Who jumps at loud noises!
Chandler: Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I thinkI'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets upand starts for the door.)
Chandler: (returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)
Chandler: Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever
Chandler: No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Chandler: You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Chandler: I do not hate Ross!
Chandler: What picture?
Chandler: Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, buty'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Chandler: When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before youwould for me. That's the bottom line.
Chandler: From a bullet!
Chandler: Much sense?!
Chandler: So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
Chandler: So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
Chandler: Really?!
Chandler: Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)
Chandler: (with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
Chandler: Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)
Chandler: I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Chandler: Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Chandler: Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Chandler: (To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Chandler: (terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It'sfast!
Chandler: Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)
Chandler: So, what are you gonna do?
Chandler: Me?! Why me?
Chandler: I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'ma lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Chandler: (To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care ofit. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away henods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)
Chandler: Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)
Chandler: Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Chandler: It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Chandler: Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in withyou and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Chandler: Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you twoare gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Chandler: You mean scared.
Chandler: Scared? Happy?
Chandler: I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you livedwith Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go tobed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Chandler: Were you're parents happy, or something?
Chandler: Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
Chandler: Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move inwith her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Chandler: (pause) Yeah, you're right about that.
Chandler: Hi!
Chandler: Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
Chandler: He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very luckylady.
Chandler: Im sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Chandler: Hey Gar!
Chandler: Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Chandler: All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in thegame.)
Chandler: What?
Chandler: I'm not a dropper!
Chandler: It's throwing and catching!
Chandler: Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses controland almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)
Chandler: Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Chandler: Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Chandler: Not fun anymore?
Chandler: Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you canwork it out!
Chandler: Oh that is over!
Chandler: You guys wanna eat here?
Chandler: Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anythingbut a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, thephone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of hischest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)
Chandler: Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Chandler: Okay, so Richard, Richard!
Chandler: What?
Chandler: How much did I love The King and I? (Oh, you get thepoint by now.)
Chandler: You okay there man?
Chandler: Wow umm, calm down.

Chandler: You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Chandler: Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Chandler: Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Chandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Chandler: All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?
Chandler: Thank you.
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat orwill all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a bighotel suite?
Chandler: I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a bighotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Chandler: So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Chandler: All right, bye-bye now!
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the roadonce.
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: Isn't that Ross's money?
Chandler: I don't know.
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: Too dry.
Chandler: No!
Chandler: No!
Chandler: Yes.
Chandler: I also said, "Yes!"
Chandler: No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!
Chandler: Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Chandler: They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Chandler: Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Chandler: Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Chandler: All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question likethat I'll lie.
Chandler: All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out rightnow!
Chandler: You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Chandler: All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's nosidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Chandler: I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game whereyou-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Chandler: Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was thatuh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to doanything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, heshould've pushed me off of the bridge.
Chandler: Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some giftsthat I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear withone leg?
Chandler: (who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him!I wanna talk to him!
Chandler: Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to himif he won't even talk to me?
Chandler: That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket ofporn
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: (To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!
Chandler: (To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him allweek! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it inperson.
Chandler: (To Joey) Hey!
Chandler: No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want toprove that to you in person!
Chandler: Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Chandler: Uh, what was that?
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just yourannoying friend Chandler.
Chandler: Huh.
Chandler: Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Wow!
Chandler: Do we have to?
Chandler: Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Chandler: Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Chandler: Yes.
Chandler: It's a great idea. (They kiss)
Chandler: Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary.
Chandler: (coughing) Art lover!
Chandler: I said art lover.
Chandler: I don't know, I'm very tired. 
Chandler: So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Chandler: Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Chandler: (To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.
Chandler: Can I give you a present now?
Chandler: Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man!Dont tell me I did this!
Chandler: How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present,please forgive me" not fake out?
Chandler: Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversaryever!
Chandler: What-what Richard thing?
Chandler: What Richard thing?
Chandler: (talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.
Chandler: Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)
Chandler: Oh my God.
Chandler: Love your condoms my man.
Chandler: Why?! What happened?!
Chandler: No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don'thave to share everything with everybody.
Chandler: No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Chandler: When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me aboutit!
Chandler: Thanks. (They hug.)
Chandler: (pushing her away from another hug) Next time?
Chandler: There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Chandler: That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Chandler: Fine with me!
Chandler: What are you talking
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: (interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believethis is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Chandler: Whoa!
Chandler: Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper bodyand hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)
Chandler: Good luck! 
Chandler: I see.
Chandler: (totally confused) What?
Chandler: What's an identical hand twin?
Chandler: Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
Chandler: (totally confused) How?
Chandler: Again I must go back to, how?
Chandler: (Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Chandler: No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away.Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Chandler: No!
Chandler: That was Joey!
Chandler: Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)
Chandler: (walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.
Chandler: What does it look like? I'm going home.
Chandler: Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of anaked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.
Chandler: Really?!
Chandler: Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Chandler: (arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!
Chandler: Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)
Chandler: Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Chandler: Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Chandler: 8. 8!
Chandler: If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Chandler: Noo!
Chandler: Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
Chandler: Two fours.
Chandler: Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we getthe biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motionsto Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.
Chandler: (sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we werefighting about!
Chandler: Another hard 8.
Chandler: Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) andwe get married here tonight.
Chandler: You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Chandler: Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Chandler: Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!{Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. Iguess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Chandler: Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Chandler: (spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Chandler: All right! 
Chandler: Here it is! Here it is!
Chandler: It's a four.
Chandler: Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a bluesweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Chandler: Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
Chandler: Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
Chandler: I don't think so.
Chandler: (looks around) Here justtake this. (Hands her the sweater.)
Chandler: No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Chandler: Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
Chandler: Hello! One marriage please!
Chandler: (singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Chandler: Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Chandler: Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna getmarried!
Chandler: Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna getmarried!
Chandler: Oh my God!
Chandler: Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Yes! Well that-yes.
Chandler: We actually missed it.
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: Hi!
Chandler: So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Chandler: Its a buffet man.
Chandler: Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Chandler: Monica and I almost got married last night.
Chandler: Look, I just dont think Monica and I are ready to get marriedyet! Yknow? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming outof that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.Yknow? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: (returning with Joey) Hi.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or
Chandler: (not quite sure) You did.
Chandler: Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this onesfree, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third ones free.
Chandler: I dont know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Chandler: So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they haveall the marriages thing? I love you.
Chandler: Yes, we dont get married unless theres a sign! Okay, sosay uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then theres a definitesign that we should get married.
Chandler: Sounds great.
Chandler: Ready!
Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.
Chandler: That was so unlikely. Well, lets get married! I guess.
Chandler: Thats right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Chandler: Yeah. (They go pack.) Were doing the right thing, right?
Chandler: Well you did pull his hair.
Chandler: Im not getting into this again!
Chandler:  Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay.(He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go ofMonica who is only holding on by his neck.)
Chandler: No!
Chandler: All right, should we just, should we just get married? Yknow? Imean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Chandler: Me too!
Chandler: No!
Chandler: Jeez, relax! Its not like were mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)
Chandler: (entering, slowly) Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpackhere?
Chandler: Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Chandler: Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Imsaying?
Chandler: Me asking is kind of a sign.
Chandler: Okay!!!!!
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Oh thanks.
Chandler: The door hasnt been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.)Ready?!
Chandler: Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I cant getin!
Chandler: This is not a sign!
Chandler: Its an old key!
Chandler: I love you!
Chandler: Are you hugging the door right now.
Chandler: Yeah-yeah, me neither.
Chandler: The keys stuck in the lock.
Chandler: (trying the handle) It still doesnt work.
Chandler: Oh.
Chandler: Nice job Joe! Youre quite the craftsmen.
Chandler: Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Chandler: No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.
Chandler: No, no, I keep trying, yknow? I can get out, "Joey, I havetoo" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to thebathroom." He may think Im sick.
Chandler: Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonnaorder me around all the time?
Chandler: All right.
Chandler: No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, heresthe thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, Im gonna be movingout man.
Chandler: Look, I-Im just gonna be right across the hall and I promiseyou, the minute Monica and I break up Im moving right back in with you!
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: (looking down) What gave me away?
Chandler: Okay, so thats it, everybody knows! Its official,were moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Chandler: Wow that was my scariest voice! Youre very brave.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called meSha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.
Chandler: Well, I-I still think youre very-very nice and very pretty
Chandler: (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
Chandler: Rach
Chandler: Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Chandler: Well, Joeys my best friend.
Chandler: You just said Of course youre my best friend. Would youplease tell Rachel though?
Chandler: Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reachesfor one.)
Chandler: Hey-hey!
Chandler: I am now!
Chandler: Okay, bye! (Exits.)
Chandler: Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all thesame stuff.
Chandler: Not once did we do that.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Oh yeah? Well, howd she take it?
Chandler: And youre upset because you didnt make your best friendcry?
Chandler: Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Pheebs, I dont understand. How can you have a roommate that noneof us know anything about?
Chandler: Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursdays was just our thing man!
Chandler: Who was it?
Chandler: Sure!
Chandler: Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe itcould be a game room, yknow? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like SpaceInvaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Chandler: Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interestingidea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."
Chandler: So, thats it?
Chandler: Which is why Asteroids is perfect! Its the oldest game!
Chandler: I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room,especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Chandler: No, Im not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautifulguest room. (Exits.)
Chandler: Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Chandler: (reading the ad) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker,non-ugly." Nice!
Chandler: Hi.
Chandler: Hi, listen, Im sorry about before. I dont need to have agame room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnt getgirls, and now I can emNow, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-notthat I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I seewomen
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: Ohh.
Chandler: Thats a great idea! We can easily think of a way for usboth to enjoy the room.
Chandler: We dont have to come up with this now.
Chandler: Hey, yknow what? Why dont we think about changes we canmake in the living room?
Chandler: Yeah, I mean were gonna have to move around some furniture tomake room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)
Chandler: Is that a problem?
Chandler: Oh, thats cool. Then Ill just bring them both over.
Chandler: Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everythinghere is yours! Ill get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Chandler: In the game room!
Chandler: All right! Thats fine! Thats fine! I wont bring overthe chairs! I wont bring anything over! I wouldnt want to ruin the ambianceover here at Grandmas place!! (Storms out.)
Chandler: (entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potentialroommate) Hi! Ill be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)
Chandler: Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Chandler: Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mockshim and he joins in.)
Chandler: Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot forthe love.
Chandler: Thats laughter.
Chandler: I dont know.
Chandler: Yeah, I do.
Chandler: Hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Chandler: Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Chandler: Of course!
Chandler: Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: Oh my God! Someones killed Square Man!
Chandler: Oh thats so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Chandler: Yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Chandler: Yknow? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signsand hang it over our bed. Because, thats you and I together! Merge!
Chandler: Really?!
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Oh, whats the matter?
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go?
Chandler: Oh hi!
Chandler: Why dont you open with a joke?
Chandler: Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not talking aboutChuckles University?!
Chandler: Thats the way I did it til I was 19.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
Chandler: (opens and reads it) "Benefits lapsed."
Chandler: Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insuranceexpired because, you didnt work enough last year.
Chandler: All right.
Chandler: Im sorry man, theres never a good time to (pauses) stopcatching on fire.
Chandler: Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?
Chandler: Whats wrong with you?
Chandler: This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
Chandler: Thats a hernia.
Chandler: Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.)Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Chandler: I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and lets justget that thingpushed back in.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Oh Joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing alittle laser eye surgery wont fix!
Chandler: Listen, Im really glad you got the part.
Chandler: But are you sure you can do this?
Chandler: Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Chandler: Im sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why dont you uh, lift up yourshirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) Wehave a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Chandler: What are you doing?
Chandler: Oh, all right.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think thiswas a successful marriage?
Chandler: Ross, just for my own piece of mind, youre not married toanymore of us are ya?
Chandler: You left a shoe here?!
Chandler: Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to givehim your shoe.
Chandler: (not enthused) Yeah, all right.
Chandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Chandler: Yeah, Im gonna pass. Cause I was kinda iffy when it waspuppies.
Chandler: Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right,Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenlysmells something. Its times like these Im glad Smell-O-Vision hasnt beeninvented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When youre done over there, we kinda have asituation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)
Chandler: See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve beenplaying these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Chandler: I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have ourown zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yknow Mon, you can be incharge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they puttheir hands around (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab hisfinger.)
Chandler: Okay, Im a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Chandler: What equity investments?
Chandler: You dont even have a car!
Chandler: And?
Chandler: There you are.
Chandler: (entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, theycan meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)
Chandler: He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Chandler: Theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way overprotective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
Chandler: Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to checkon the babies again.)
Chandler: (entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybeyoure right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Chandler: I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Chandler: Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Yknow? And itturns out I was wrong. And now its lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying tocough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)
Chandler: But you found the keys to his clothes?
Chandler: That is true.
Chandler: Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me.
Chandler: I think thats gum.
Chandler: Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroythe universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Chandler: And protected them from a tornado?
Chandler: Was the setting of Phoebes triumph.
Chandler: Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babiesall by herself.
Chandler: (pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Chandler: (watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stickso that hes scratching his back with it.) Listen, Im gonna be moving out so youwill be in charge of paying the rent.
Chandler: First of the month.
Chandler: No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Chandler: Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)
Chandler: Thats our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung thiswhole me moving out on thing, so why dont I justwhy dont I just coveryou for a while?
Chandler: Its not charity, Joe
Chandler: Okay uh, heres the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)
Chandler: Uh, yeah.
Chandler: So, well do the rest of the bills later then?
Chandler: No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnttake it.
Chandler: I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow?But I have to trick him into taking it so I wont hurt his pride.
Chandler: Well that would help the pride thing.
Chandler: Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Chandler: Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing.
Chandler: Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Chandler: Yes, but for the last time.
Chandler: Hes at a dinner party.
Chandler: Oh, I wish Id know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Chandler: Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night.What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Chandler: Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Chandler: Okay, lets play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Chandler: Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, onegoal, $1,000.
Chandler: Oh yes!
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: No! No! No! No(Joey looks at him)one can beat me.
Chandler: See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to doall the kicking.
Chandler: Still broken?
Chandler: Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about alittle uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)
Chandler: Okay, uh, how about, how aboutyknow what? We could play anew game. A new game, its fun.
Chandler: Cups.
Chandler: Ill teach ya! Come on, come on, its really easy andreally, really fun.
Chandler: Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens,what do you have?
Chandler: Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Chandler: Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again. (He deals out two cards eachagain.) What do you got?
Chandler: Youre kidding right?
Chandler: Well thats a full cup! (Pays him again.)
Chandler: You win.
Chandler: It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. Thatmy friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Chandler: Not 700 exactly?
Chandler: Double it! (He does.)
Chandler: Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Chandler: Hey, I didnt make up the rules. Now, after you receive thedoubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing yourtotal to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Dont get to excited because thats notgonna happen unless you getNo way! (He takes the top card, which is the two ofclubs. Of course, any card wouldve won. Chandler pays him.)
Chandler: Whats wrong?
Chandler: Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Chandler: Oh man!!
Chandler: All right, lets play one more hand! One more!
Chandler: I cant take the big white dog! You love it!
Chandler: No, but waitwhat if I bought it from you, yknow? And yournice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?
Chandler: When did I try to give you money?
Chandler: Im just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure thatyoure okay.
Chandler: (entering) Hey.
Chandler: I know. (He kisses her.)
Chandler: No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
Chandler: Sure!
Chandler: I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Chandler: Exactly.
Chandler: Its not a real game! I made it up!
Chandler: At a fake game!!
Chandler: Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Chandler: Hmm, lets see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cardsand shrugs.)
Chandler: (not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Ross and Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Chandler: Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story foryou. 
Chandler: So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Chandler: Unbelievable
Chandler: Hey, look at all the boxes!
Chandler: All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out withthat girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumpedinto each other at the supermarket?
Chandler: Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Chandler: No-no
Chandler: OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns aroundand sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guessJoey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears thegiggling again)
Chandler: (pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Chandler: Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monicas gonna be workinglate, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know whatelse I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now whowouldn't wanna live with me?
Chandler: Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirtingthing?
Chandler: What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Chandler: Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Chandler: Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I foundit.
Chandler: She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Chandler: She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Chandler: I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Chandler: No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her rightnow. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.
Chandler: Hey Mon, how's it going?
Chandler: Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
Chandler: No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Chandler: It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.
Chandler: We should start with the big stuff. Yknow? That'll be theeasiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I gotit. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)
Chandler: What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with thecarpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up onthe...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK, OK, here'swhat we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Chandler: OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Chandler: Yes, but the coffee table doesn't matchthe...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Chandler: Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and wewent to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could notstop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Chandler: Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Chandler: That's not specific to girls.
Chandler: And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Chandler: Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Chandler: Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Chandler: (blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here!R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Chandler: (to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed toosee me naked.
Chandler: Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and youcan come back later.
Chandler: Bye! Thank God
Chandler: Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everythingback into its original place.
Chandler: That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photoalbum)
Chandler: Uh-huh
Chandler: No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the roomgot so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)
Chandler: Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes Iwanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I movedeverything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm verysorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Chandler: Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Chandler: Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Chandler: Hi, my names Chandler. I just moved in next door and I waswondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for controlof the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Chandler: So, is Janine around?
Chandler: Can I check out what she did to my room?
Chandler: (The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Ohmy God. What is th its like a guy never lived in here. Look, youve gotto be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.) Itsspreading already.
Chandler: (Picking up a pillow.) Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on thecouch?
Chandler: (Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny littlebox, thats too small to put anything in?
Chandler: No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If youlet this go, youre going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Chandler: Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Chandler: Defend yourself.
Chandler: Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally differentsituation.
Chandler: Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Chandler: Ohh, yeah.
Chandler: Thats weird. I dont think my boss likes me either.
Chandler: Yeah lets head off to work.
Chandler: You knowOh My God.
Chandler: (Sarcastically) Really.
Chandler: Yeah, what was wrong with your oldhuman teeth.
Chandler: No, no no no. Youll be fine. (turning to Monica) Hillarysbind, right?
Chandler: Yeah. (Rachel walks in.)
Chandler: What???
Chandler: I am proud of all my friends today.
Chandler: Hi, Im Chandler. Your live-in boy
Chandler: Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)
Chandler: Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? Imgoing to go over to Joeys.
Chandler: Yes, but I feel like Ive really gotten in touch with my feminineside enough today. You know. In fact I think were two sachets away from becoming alesbian couple.
Chandler: Nah, Nah, its okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. Youknow, do kind of like a man thing.
Chandler: You know when guys hang out they dont just drink some beer andhammer up drywall?
Chandler: No thanks, Josephine.
Chandler: Hey Ross, I was wondering if Oh my God!! Where areall the men???
Chandler: Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl withthe flowers.
Chandler: What is the matter with you ?!?
Chandler: Youre arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) Yougot dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This isnot Joey!!
Chandler: Youre turning into a women.
Chandler: Now Ive upset you? What did I say?
Chandler: Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Chandler: Oh! Thats great, they havent seen the place since I movedin!
Chandler: (shocked at the news) Why cant I tell them that we livetogether?
Chandler: Why havent you told them?!
Chandler: Why havent you told them?! Wouldnt they be happy?!
Chandler: Why wouldnt they be happy?
Chandler: What? What? Why?!
Chandler: Is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me?
Chandler: Yknow, itll be okay. Itll be okay. Because when theycome over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and thenwell tell em.
Chandler: Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didnt I?
Chandler: Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! Youre parents like me,right?
Chandler: Well Monica just told me that they dont.
Chandler: (annoyed) Do you know why?
Chandler: (angry) Well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess!
Chandler: This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Chandler: Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to mynew apartment.
Chandler: [mocks that last comment].
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear,let us take off your coats!
Chandler: Whoa, snowing out there?
Chandler: Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, yknow Ive always felt thathow a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Chandler: (worried) Hes the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Chandler: Oh, yes. Well its very beautiful. Its cream-colored andtight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked.Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I dont mean tight, I mean itsnot too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into hishands.]
Chandler: (shocked) What?
Chandler: You do? Why?
Chandler: What?! Why did you do that?
Chandler: How could it not matter?!
Chandler: What about all that friends forever stuff?
Chandler: Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it onme!
Chandler: The reason we havent told them were together is becausethey hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Chandler: Yeah, Im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Chandler: (clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, thatIm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy mydessert.
Chandler: (lying) Yes, but if its any consolation, before the bird droppedit, he seemed to enjoy it.
Chandler: Thank you!
Chandler: (In a parent-like tone) Ill talk to them! 
Chandler: Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? Iremember when people used to use big lights.
Chandler: I dunno what it is, it just doesnt quite feel like Christmas tome.
Chandler: See now it feels like Christmas!
Chandler: Hey Joe whats up?
Chandler: I can see why thats hard to resist.
Chandler: You are aware that shes not a monkey, right?
Chandler: Ah, youre still just a little fat girl inside arent you?(He kisses her on the cheek)
Chandler: What, what are you laughing at?
Chandler: I dont think so.
Chandler: (To Rachel) Oh my God!
Chandler: I can save you time ladies, Im right here.
Chandler: What? Thats terrible!
Chandler: Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
Chandler: No not okay, you cant look for Monicas presents!
Chandler: No, you dont have to, and you cant because I live heretoo.
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Chandler: If I help, we can find em faster!
Chandler: Yknow when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall andlook, you dont, you dont do that every year do you?
Chandler: You dont, like go into the back of my closet, and look under mygym bag or anything?
Chandler: Because thats where Joey gave me some stuff to store thatIve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weirdclicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)
Chandler: I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Chandler: Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Chandler: Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Chandler: Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Chandler: Oh, hey guys!
Chandler: Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Chandler: Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonderwhat I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Oh great!
Chandler: Okay! Okay! Okay!
Chandler: Wait, we cant do this.
Chandler: I dont wanna know what Monica got me. Yknow? I mean, look,Im sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me,and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not whatChristmas is about.
Chandler: Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I dont know about you guys,but I wanna see the look on Monicas face when I give her my present, and Imsure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just,can we put them back?
Chandler: Fine!
Chandler: Thats what you got me?
Chandler: Now you do that, youre on TV.
Chandler: Thats great!
Chandler: So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
Chandler: So shes just waiting over there for ya?
Chandler: (entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell thepost office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.(Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)
Chandler: Im not your garbage man. Im your mailman.
Chandler: A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)
Chandler: You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Chandler: You made pottery?
Chandler: Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore
Chandler: so then the farmer says, "Thats not a cow andyoure not milking it." (Everyone laughs.) 
Chandler: Look at us, were a couple of couples!
Chandler: Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.
Chandler: And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Handsit to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldnt afford it,because you paid dinner last night.
Chandler: Oh thats too bad.
Chandler: Thats funny, I saw no phlegm.
Chandler: Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Chandler: Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Chandler: So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She waslying to our faces?!
Chandler: And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
Chandler: No, you shNo you said you made that up!!
Chandler: Eh, theyre both good. I generally just go with, Monicasdrunk again. (Monica glares at him.) 
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Okay, one more time.
Chandler: Perfect decibel.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Oh nothing, were just talking. Yknow, blah-blah-blah.
Chandler: Thats totally understandable.
Chandler: Oh yeah!
Chandler: And Im blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watchingmodern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) "Oh Chandler,I just lost myself in the moment."
Chandler: (To Monica) Yknow I think you can take her.
Chandler: Did you hear that?
Chandler: Yeah, Im sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?
Chandler: Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Chandler: You okay?
Chandler: That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
Chandler: I made that joke up.
Chandler: Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniestjoke hed ever heard.
Chandler: Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
Chandler: Seriously?
Chandler: Yeah, I guess.
Chandler: (jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, Playboyprinted my joke.
Chandler: Its my joke.
Chandler: Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heartis having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Chandler: Nah, Monicas watching some cooking show. Come on, I dontwant to miss when they were skinny.
Chandler: What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and thescreen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?
Chandler: Joey, why is your cable out?
Chandler: If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you somemoney?
Chandler: Whoa ho.
Chandler: (picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealerwill let us watch the show at his place?
Chandler: (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phonebill?
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Chandler: And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
Chandler: (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Chandler: So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Chandler: Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Chandler: Yeah!
Chandler: Okay (he goes to sit down).
Chandler: (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it. 
Chandler: You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Rossdid? He stole my joke. You know what? Im going to get a joke journal. Yknow?And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Chandler: Yeah!
Chandler: Picking Rachel.
Chandler: Maybe its the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealingmy thoughts.
Chandler: So is your apron. Youre wearing it like a cape.
Chandler: I think its great that you work here. Youre going to makea lot of money, and heres your first tip: Dont eat yellow snow. (He laughs,then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15,coffeehouse.
Chandler: Its my joke.
Ross and Chandler: Its my joke.
Chandler: Lets have Monica decide.
Chandler: Yeah!
Chandler: Mon, get out here!
Chandler: Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Chandler: Because youre the only one that can be fair.
Chandler: (to Ross) Dont try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) Imyour only chance to have a baby. Okay, lets go.
Chandler: Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Chandler: Can I finish my story?!
Chandler: So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Stevesdoctors name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, Doctor Monkey? And that is howthe whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize hispoint.)
Chandler: Im not arguing with that.
Chandler: Is not.
Chandler: Hi, oh hi.
Chandler: (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient,together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may beperceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and(He falters andMonica prompts him.)generosity of spirit.
Chandler: (To Chandler) Im out of words. Should I just say the whole thingagain?
Chandler: (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) Youre a littlehigh maintenance.
Chandler: Im sorry. Youre not easy-going, but yourepassionate, and thats good. And when you get upset about the little things, I thinkthat Im pretty good about making you feel better about that. And thats goodtoo. So, they can say that youre high maintenance, but its okay, because Ilike  maintaining you.
Chandler: (happily) Im off the list. (Sits on the couch.) 
Chandler: Hey, buddy boy, howd the audition go?
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. Im not answeringthat. 
Chandler: This coming from the man who couldnt split our 80 dollar phonebill in half.
Chandler: Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldnt you be at work?
Chandler: Im so sorry youre sick.
Chandler: Im gonna grab you some tissue.
Chandler: Yes?
Chandler: Oh my God, introduce us!
Chandler: Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glaresat him.)
Chandler: I know, lets rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass oforange juice.)
Chandler: That would be impossible to resist if you werent all drippyhere. (Points to his nose.)
Chandler: Yeah, I dont you should say that even when youre healthy.
Chandler: Dont take this personally okay? Its just that I justcant have sex with a sick person.
Chandler: Thats the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe ofmwha-ah-libe.
Chandler: Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up fromthe couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductivelyon the bed. Or at least shes trying too and as he enters the room, she takes therobe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!
Chandler: Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
Chandler: I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no!No-no honey! Yknow whats sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy.And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Chandler: Would you please get some rest!
Chandler: Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no!
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: So youre just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Chandler: Its nice.
Chandler: Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)
Chandler: Its all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So youwanna go uh, mix it up?
Chandler: Oh come on you big faker!
Chandler: Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Chandler: Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.)
Chandler: (calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?
Chandler: We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Chandler: Hes taking off her coat!
Chandler: Ho-oh, hes gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glarefrom the streetlight out of his apartment. Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapesthere so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well,Im off to bed! (Goes to bed.)
Chandler: Im good.
Chandler: (looking) Is that a swing?
Chandler: Yuck!
Chandler: That was like 5 years ago.
Chandler: Joey
Chandler: (totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambiis a cartoon!
Chandler: Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Chandler: Im not macho.
Chandler: No, I guess I just never really cried. Yknow? Im not acrying kind of guy.
Chandler: Id be sad sure, but I wouldnt cry.
Chandler: Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, Im rich!
Chandler: Oh, thats Parents Day, first grade. Thats me withthe janitor Martin.
Chandler: Oh they didnt want to come!
Chandler: No! Look, I dont cry! Its not a big deal! Okay?!
Chandler: You didnt get more movies that are gonna have us reaching forthe tissues all night did you?
Chandler: Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.
Chandler: Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I dont do porn.
Chandler: Her ankle is what youre watching?
Chandler: Shes just doing her job!
Chandler: Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under thecouch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)
Chandler: Theres no back to this couch!
Chandler: Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow? Maybe one of thosestories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all deadinside.
Chandler: Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Chandler: No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married,were up at the altar and Im like this. (Makes a bored face.)
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: Okay, well I wont uh, worry about this anymore then.
Chandler: Aww, I love you so
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: So you didnt mean any of that?!
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: (To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Chandler: (crying hysterically) I just dont see why those two cantwork things out!
Chandler: (starts crying) I-I cant believe Jills gone. (They alllook at him.) I cant help it, I opened a gate.
Chandler: Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Chandler: Sure I would!
Chandler: What, you guys really think that Im that shallow?
Chandler: What if I had had the guts to quit my job? Id probably bewriting for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my jobs fun too! Imean tomorrow, I-I dont have to wear a tie.
Chandler: (entering, depressed) Hey.
Chandler: Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing wasfunny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Chandler: Was his question whats more boring than him?
Chandler: Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Chandler: Ehh.
Chandler: I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: All right!
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Well its kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busyschedule and the fact that hes not real.
Chandler: Uh-oh, its my boss!
Chandler: (reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins.Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Chandler: Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?! 
Chandler: I always thought having a heart attack was natures way oftelling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But youre not gonna die. I mean, you aregoing to die, but youre not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Chandler: Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring mefood." Two is, "Im with a girl, bring us food." Three is,"Im lost and I cant find food."
Chandler: (approaching) Here you go Joe, heres the freshly squeezed orangejuice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: Im sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Chandler: Okay, anything for you sir?
Chandler: Its not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
Chandler: Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Chandler: Aww.
Chandler: You wanna share it?
Chandler: Whats this?
Chandler: Aww, thanks man. (They hug.)
Chandler: Oh you wouldnt uh, care. Its just a stupid comic bookstory.
Chandler: Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but hedoesnt want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as hisassistas his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring himmilkshakes that cant have lumps in them.
Chandler: No, the doctors say it may kill her.
Chandler: (To Ross) But I think we should tell her.
Chandler: Listen Phoebe, hes right. People are not supposed to have heartattacks at 31.
Chandler: Uh, what about yknow the massage thing? That never gave you aheart attack.
Chandler: Im sorry youre here with me instead of Roger.
Chandler: Well, I could make it seem like hes here. (Imitates him.)"Heres some little known facts about cous-cous. They didnt add the secondcous until 1979." (Mumbles something further.)
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: What was tonight?
Chandler: Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?
Chandler: With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monicashrugs.) Oh my God!
Chandler: Four different women! Ive had sex way more times!
Chandler: Nine.
Chandler: Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfectguy?
Chandler: Hey thats what I tell girls about me.
Chandler: No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happenfor you.
Chandler: Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)
Chandler: So was I.
Chandler: We cant do this.
Chandler: Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot ofpressure on me, yknow? Because youve been waiting a very long time and Iwouldnt want to disappoint you.
Chandler: I do like that.
Chandler: Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be fortonight, right?
Chandler: Stop it! Were doing this! Lets do it!
Chandler: Okay! (They both get up.)
Chandler: I have some moves.
Chandler: Yeah, lets just forget it.
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: Oh yeah.
Chandler: (sexily) Yeah?
Chandler: Oh my God!
Chandler: Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no waita minute that was you!
Chandler: So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Chandler: Oh. Oh right! Right! Because youre still seeing him and uh,hes a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when (He fakes falling asleep.)
Chandler: Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Chandler: I bet he can.
Chandler: Oh yeah! Yeah! Dont worry about me, Ill be fine! (Does akara-tay move.)
Chandler: (sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?
Chandler: Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Chandler: Im the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.) 
Chandler: Because you shouldnt be with him. (Pause.) You should be withme.
Chandler: Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look,things like last night they dont just happen. Yknow? Or at least not to me. Orwith the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and Icouldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknowwith a friend.
Chandler: I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknowbecause I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and Iguess Im not technically a "doctor"
Chandler: No, there were two.
Chandler: Oh yeah.
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Chandler: I see where youre goin!
Chandler: (reminiscing) Ah, finally an explanation.
Chandler: Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Chandler: Okay, look I need your help, I dont know what to get her forValentines Day.
Chandler: (laughs) She was working on Valentines Day so werecelebrating it tonight.
Chandler: Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and herbrother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) Icant do that we promised wed make each other gifts this year.
Chandler: Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Chandler: I made a (Does one of those gibberish words.)
Chandler: Nothing!
Chandler: Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Chandler: (admiring his work) This, this actually is a (Does the samegibberish word from before.)
Chandler: Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentines Daygifts?
Chandler: Do we have to make the entire thing?
Chandler: Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the placewhere I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Chandler: (sticking his head back in) What?
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?
Chandler: I cant figure out what to make Monica.
Chandler: Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here thatlooks homemade?
Chandler: Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me tothe moon.
Chandler: Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.
Chandler: Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hateMonica" on the bottom.
Chandler: Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way,and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Thenhe holds it out as if hes giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throwsit down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out apair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties hejust removed.) I cant do it. I cant do it. (He throws them both down andcontinues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! Amixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)
Chandler: Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Chandler: Okay, come here! Come here.
Chandler: Now, its not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Chandler: But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Chandler: (momentarily terrified) Maybe well have to listen and see!
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: Yeah!
Chandler: Its a sock bunny.
Chandler: Not really.
Chandler: I see. Yknow umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Chandler: Oh, its okay. I dont
Chandler: (thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (Theyboth run into the bedroom.)
Chandler: Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way toyoung to have seen that!
Chandler: You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.

Chandler: Oh my good God.
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: (disgusted) What does it say?!
Chandler: Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you arethe queen of everything.
Chandler: (To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (Heswearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
Chandler: So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Chandler: Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Chandler: Hi, how are ya?
Chandler: (whispering in Joeys ear) The reason he just said.
Chandler: Yeah, Ive been there my friend.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Ill give up my ticket.

Chandler: Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? Icant figure this out! Its so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page)Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah! Paper cut!
Chandler: No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont wantMonica to find out.
Chandler: Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my bestfriends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Chandler: Me too.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Oh all right.
Chandler: Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place.
Chandler: Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store weve been too andI cant find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and startspointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers iswatching him.) Its a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)
Chandler: Yknow, Im so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Chandler: Yeah, Im gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another displaycounter.) Oh, this ones nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh,kind sir? Can I see this one?
Chandler: Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.

Chandler: Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Chandler: Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but Ileft my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, Ill go get it. You guard the ring.
Chandler: No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)

Chandler: Okay! (Pushes him away.)
Chandler: Do you have my credit card?
Chandler: Thank God! (Grabs his card.)
Chandler: Oh, I cant go.
Chandler: Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go withthe one I picked first.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: They put you in jail?
Chandler: Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Chandler: Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Chandler: It was the ring!
Chandler: I cant believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumballmachine looking ring!
Chandler: No, its not! When I looked at the other ring I could seeMonicas face when I gave it to her, yknow? And I could see her saying yes.When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and thenI can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thingIm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure its perfect.
Chandler: I cant do that.
Chandler: Okay and he hasnt proposed yet because she has no ring on herfinger.
Chandler: Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Chandler: (to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store,the ring youre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, Imgonna need to have that back. (The guy isnt sure.) But, in exchange Im willingto trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.
Chandler: No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring.You dont want to break her heart now do you?
Chandler: Yeah, shes dying Of a cough apparently.
Chandler: (interrupting her) Okay, thats enough honey!
Chandler: Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)
Chandler: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And youare about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and hes horrified.) Hey! Immarrying a dead woman!
Chandler: Guys? (They ignore him.) Ive got something important to tell ya.(Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over totry and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) Im gonna ask Monica tomarry me.
Chandler: Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)
Chandler: Yep, pretty much.
Chandler: (goes to hug him and stops short) HeyyyyWhat?
Chandler: Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait til uh, it was officialyknow? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because youre my bestfriends.
Chandler: Im gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Chandler: I know.
Chandler: Check out the ring.
Chandler: Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You canunderstand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the gameon TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)
Chandler: Okay, well tonights the big night.
Chandler: It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant.Im going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knowshow expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast Imjust gonna propose.
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: Im not gonna mess it up.
Chandler: Shes not gonna say no.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: (To Phoebe) Give me it!
Chandler: Phoebe!
Chandler: (with his mouthful) Hi Monica.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: (glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler cant go. Weregoing to dinner remember?!
Chandler: I just get mad when Rachel doesnt remember where weregoing.
Chandler: Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Chandler: Oh, so youre already doing your part for the kids.
Chandler: Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didnt agree to that!
Chandler: Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (Makes like a gun withhis fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink inall excited.) Whats going on little elves?
Chandler: Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goesover to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?
Chandler: Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be asurprise and shes gonna know.
Chandler: (To Monica) You are beautiful.
Chandler: (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, underGod. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (Its abutchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreignfriends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.) 
Chandler: Yes! Yes! Im good! Are you good? Are you good? Iseverythingare youare you perrr-perfect?!
Chandler: Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no youcant have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you weregoing to be cold, you shouldve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, areyou okay? Are you okay?
Chandler: Yes! Im fine. In fact Ive been fine for a long time nowand I think, the reason is you.
Chandler: Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and Icouldnt imagine growing old with
Chandler: (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just letme say it.
Chandler: What?! Im Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandlerturns and looks) Oh, thats Richard!
Chandler: Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I dont know why I didthat!
Chandler: (to Richards date) And uh, you dont have a mustache whichis good. (She just smiles.) Im Chandler; I make jokes when Im uncomfortable.
Chandler: Hi.
Chandler: Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles athim.) See I, did it again.
Chandler: Yeah, Ill sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)
Chandler: Yes. (Thinking hes gone.)
Chandler: I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both myparents making love to the same guy.
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have wegot a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Chandler: Richard!
Chandler: Oh you knew that. Good!
Chandler: For camp!
Chandler: Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if youre notcareful you may not get married at all this year!
Chandler: (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!
Chandler: Richard was there so I couldnt do it!
Chandler: Im gonna do it tomorrow yknow, and-and surprise her, butnow youve ruined it!
Chandler: Who walks into a room and asks to see a persons hands?!
Chandler: This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Chandler: Thats right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriageis the last thing on my mind.
Chandler: I can do that, Ive had 30 years of practice.
Chandler: Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do Ilook? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.)Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary itis and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Chandler: Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, whywould anybody ever want to get married huh?
Chandler: Eh
Chandler: Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage isunnatural. I mean look at pigs. Lets take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigsdont mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in alifetime, and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports!
Chandler: If marriage worked, Id be all for it. But do you know what thedivorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Chandler: Well, never say never but yknow probably uh yeah, never.
Chandler: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind ofstrategy? Why dont you put down your copy of The Rules huh mantrap?!
Chandler: (to them) Its okay, I got a plan.
Chandler: I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: MyOh my God!
Chandler: Hes not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! Imsupposed to do that!
Chandler: Well what Yknow what Im gonna do? Im gonna goover there; Im gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!
Chandler: Youre right.
Chandler: Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) Im gonna get the ring!Im gonna get the ring! (Does so) Im gonna go find her and (starts running forthe door) Im just going to propose!
Chandler: Okay great.
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: Where is she? Im not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walksin.)
Chandler: (examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on acoaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Chandler: Well where did she go?
Chandler: Oh my God, I cant believe this! Yknow, I thoughtIthought you were a good guy.
Chandler: Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didnt tell my girlfriend thatyou love her?
Chandler: Yknow what? I cant believe this! Do you know what you did?My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Chandler: And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Chandler: But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just aplan, yknow? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all thesethings, shed be surprised!
Chandler: It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, thisisnt fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! Andthis is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for eachother! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonnapropose tonight.
Chandler: Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Didyou get a ring?
Chandler: Yknow Richardyou are a good guy.
Chandler: I cant talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
Chandler: What?
Chandler: What are you talking about?
Chandler: Well why didnt you stop her?! Why didnt you just tell herit was a plan?!
Chandler: Well where Where did she go?
Chandler: I cant believe I ruined this.
Chandler: Oh my God.
Chandler: Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought(Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that itmattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters isthat you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cryagain.) And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make youfeel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Monica and I are engaged.
Chandler: Thanks.
Chandler: (To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door.Ill be in the closet.
Chandler: Its okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.)To Monica.
Chandler: To Monica!
Chandler: So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Know what I mean?
Chandler: Theres gonna be a wedding. Youre gonna be the bride. Twohundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Chandler: (motioning with his hands) Im not worried, Im uh, Imfascinated. Yknow its like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high schoolI uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from herroom with her guitar.)
Chandler: Sure, you guys dont have this problem, youre made of wood.(Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!
Chandler: You look great!
Chandler: You okay over there?
Chandler: Oh, dont worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you hada lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Chandler: (putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please donthurt me.
Chandler: Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look,you are definitely 19.
Chandler: Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed becauseeverybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Chandler: Joe?
Chandler: Uhh, youve had a lot of sex right?
Chandler: Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kindof eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted too, but I couldnt.There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.
Chandler: Its happened to you?
Chandler: Well, whatd you do?
Chandler: (angrily) I dont think thats what they were talking aboutJoe!!
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: Yes, you can pass for 19.
Chandler: Yes!
Chandler: Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Chandler: Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. There isgoing to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theresgoing to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Chandler: We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).
Chandler: Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not justbecause its romantic, but because I can!
Chandler: Okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.
Chandler: Its Paris, who knows were here!
Chandler: Pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Chandler: Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I dont care!
Chandler: What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Chandler: (entering) Ahh, third base.
Chandler: (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
Chandler: Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)
Chandler: How is that ever going to happen?!
Chandler: (To Ross) I dont care, she slept with me.
Chandler: Thanks.
Chandler: (interrupting her just in time) Hey! Heres a dollar, consider ita deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Chandler: Okay. (Goes back to bed.)
Chandler: Whats the matter honey?
Chandler: (incredulous) Already?!
Chandler: Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Chandler: What in Gods name is that?!
Chandler: Well, you couldnt get them anyway. Ian doesnt plan anymoreand Derrick (Off of Rachel and Monicas looks) And Derrick is a name Ishouldnt know.
Chandler: Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Chandler: Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who areactually involved in the wedding?
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Centerpieces!
Chandler: Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I justthink theyre a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.)But Lilies are the clear choice.
Chandler: Uh-huh!
Chandler: Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Chandler: Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.
Chandler: What a sweet story.
Chandler: Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.(Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)
Chandler: I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourthwedding. Shes saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has hesaves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.
Chandler: Honey, its gonna be okay.
Chandler: Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we loveeach other and that were gonna get married.
Chandler: Well, I have some.
Chandler: Well, close to (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides towrite it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.) 
Chandler: Well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on thewedding?
Chandler: Well, come on, Ive been saving this money for six years and Ikinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Chandler: No, I realize that honey, but Im not gonna spend all of themoney on one party.
Chandler: Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answeris no.
Chandler: Yes, I am!
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Ehh.
Chandler: Look, I thought about it too, and Im sorry. I think we shouldspend all of the money on the wedding.
Chandler: Yeah, Im putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I toldyou that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makesyou happy then, then thats what were gonna do.
Chandler: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids,yknow? Well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Chandler: Well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? Like a small placeoutside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yknow,we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time itran through the little kitty door. Of course, wed have an apartment over the garagewhere Joey could grow old.
Chandler: Sure you do.
Chandler: You sure?
Chandler: I love you so much.
Chandler: Oh yeah, totally!
Chandler: Hey, you guys!
Chandler: So, what do you think?
Chandler: Are you kidding? Okay, Ill give you a hint; Ill give you ahint. (Points to his glasses.)
Chandler: I got glasses!
Chandler: No I didnt!
Chandler: No!
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: (sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didnt think I used towear glasses, right?
Chandler: Thats okay Pheebs, were not having a party or anything, soyou dont have to get us
Chandler: What we want honey.
Chandler: Dying people say the craziest things.
Chandler: Our kids are gonna be fat arent they.
Chandler: Hey! Hows the boat?!
Chandler: Well, its good that you finally have a place to do that.
Chandler: Do you know what I was thinkin?
Chandler: Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)
Chandler: Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Chandler: Then free as a bird. Whats up?
Chandler: Well, did-did you correct him?
Chandler: Oh no problem, maybe Ill play with my left hand.
Chandler: Does anybody know me?!
Chandler: Dont worry about it Pheebs.
Chandler: An old cookie?
Chandler: We cant accept this.
Chandler: Cause its gross.
Chandler: Okay, we owe you a present.
Chandler: I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. Wewere bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Chandler: Daddy. All right look, heres the story. (Flashback to Chandlerabout to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finishedplaying racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it wasreally steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his wayaround the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses andthats when in happened.
Chandler: Guys?
Chandler: I know.
Chandler: Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Chandler: Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Chandler: Not that big a deal? Therethere was touching of things.
Chandler: I dont want him to tell this story for years.
Chandler: If that is your father calling to tell this story then themarriage is off!
Chandler: (getting up) All right, Im off to see your dad.
Chandler: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the storyanymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face Idont mean his lap. And by face, I dont mean my ass. (Exits.)
Chandler: So you understand, Id feel a lot more comfortable if youdidnt tell people what happened. Yknow, Im a littleIm alittle embarrassed about it.
Chandler: What did you do when they found out?
Chandler: So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Chandler: Its your mommy. Its your mommy.
Chandler: That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Chandler: And say nothing?
Chandler: No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering toeach other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)
Chandler: Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Chandler: Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets betweenone another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Chandler: No Im serious, we should tell each other everything. I donot have any secrets from you.
Chandler: Oh no-no, I cant do that.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at thisrestaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk ofhis car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, were on Space Mountain andRoss starts to feel a little iffy.
Chandler: No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughshysterically.) So what was Phoebes secret?
Chandler: Thats it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Chandler: (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tellher I am sick!
Chandler: What about him?
Chandler: Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow!Dont show this to Monica! And dont tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Oh its always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! Youagain!"
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Oh yeah?
Chandler: Did you not understand the story?
Chandler: Hey! Whats up?
Chandler: Huh.
Chandler: No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!
Chandler: Nancy Thompsons getting fired! (Monica slaps him on theshoulder.)
Chandler: I had too okay?! Were getting married! Married couplescant keep secrets from one another!
Chandler: Du-ude!
Chandler: Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
Chandler: In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Chandler: Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Chandler: You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear legwarmers!
Chandler: Ross came in forth and cried!
Chandler: (To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wowwhoa!
Chandler: Hey!!!
Chandler: That was you!
Chandler: (To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
Chandler: Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)
Chandler: Yknow when I said that because were getting married thatwe should share everything and not have any secrets? 
Chandler: Yeah that was stupid. Lets not do that.
Chandler: Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldnt hang outwithall the guys in my office.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Chandler: What are you guys doing?
Chandler: Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist.
Chandler: No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whosgoing like this (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth,this shall be known as The Face.)
Chandler: I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.
Chandler: Yeah, Im not in that.
Chandler: All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going.(Does The Face while saying that last part.)
Chandler: How about those three pointers?
Chandler: And those guys were this (Doing the standard "ThisClose" gesture) close to lettin us play this time too.
Chandler: Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Chandler: They have that on the napkins at the club.
Chandler: Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I meanyknow you cant date him right?
Chandler: Dude that is so sad.
Chandler: Could I play?
Chandler: Okay. (Does The Face.)
Chandler: No, I am.
Chandler: I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)
Chandler: Okay. (Youll have to see it, I cant describe the face hemakes, but it isnt good.)
Chandler: Aww! (Smiles.)
Chandler: Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Chandler: I cant help it!
Chandler: Borrow money from me?
Chandler: Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: (Pause) Im right here!
Chandler: Im still right here!
Chandler: Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Chandler: Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get theirattention.)
Chandler: There I am!
Chandler: Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me anantihistamine.
Chandler: Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way toBrooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Chandler: I dont know, but dont worry, dont worry, because Iknow how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), lookdown, look down (He falls asleep.)
Chandler: (awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)
Chandler: Ahhh.
Chandler: Oh yeah, that looks good.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Im marrying her.
Chandler: Die Hard still great!
Chandler: Whatd you rent?
Chandler: (looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Chandler: Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Chandler: No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets allworked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Chandler: Thats sweet.
Chandler: So uh, what did this woman look like?
Chandler: Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thingcalled a mirror?
Chandler: No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both notattractive (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (Hegets up and grabs a photo album.
Chandler: Well, lets see (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, isthat her? (Pointing to the picture.)
Chandler: Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Chandler: (pause) No, were still together. Yeah we went out for twosummers, and then I broke up with her.
Chandler: Well, cause she came back the third summer and shed gottenreally fa-aa-aw-ow
Chandler: I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow"
Chandler: Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she stillfeel bad?
Chandler: Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is notamused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Chandler: Can you figure out what Im doing?
Chandler: Who?
Chandler: Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to thebathroom?!
Chandler: What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Chandler: Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a betterperson and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Chandler: (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you rememberme.
Chandler: (To Monica) Its a nickname, Ill explain later.
Chandler: Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have brokenup with you because you were overweight.
Chandler: You-you-you didnt know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, Iguess my work here is done!
Chandler: As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Imgoing to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Chandler: I would really love it if could do both.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Chandler: Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but Iwas 15!
Chandler: Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Chandler: You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Chandler: Look you have to realize I dont think of you as a thin,beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologizefor later! Look, what I mean is youre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. 
Chandler: So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still loveyou.
Chandler: Id carry you around in my pocket.
Chandler: Skidmarks still got a way with the ladies.
Chandler: Come on! Why are we here?!
Chandler: The hot chicks?
Chandler: Wow thats actually pretty cool.
Chandler: Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Chandler: You didnt bring me here to do that, did you?
Chandler: OHMYGAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? Youdidnt tell her we were getting married, did you?
Chandler: Did she freak out?
Chandler: Right.
Chandler: (laughs) You said no right?
Chandler: You said no right?!
Chandler: Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checks in the mail! Oh your babyis so cute! I cant wait to read your book Ross!!
Chandler: What do you think shes just gonna sit there quietly? Youdont think shes gonna want to make a toast? You dont think shesgonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Chandler: Yknow what? Its gonna be okay. Yknow what?Shes probably not gonna even want to come.
Chandler: No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Chandler: Yes!!
Chandler: Yes!!!
Chandler: Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about thewedding. Um, its going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! Were not even surewhy were having it.
Chandler: I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Chandler: (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Chandler: Arent you just a tinsy bit curious?
Chandler: No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Chandler: Is that what youre thinking about right now?
Chandler: Janice, Im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight.
Chandler: Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. NowMonica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Chandler: Say again?
Chandler: Feelings, such strong feelings.
Chandler: I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
Chandler: No, no, no. No-no-no. 
Chandler: No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name allthe states in six minutes. 
Chandler: Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at leastone, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica). 
Chandler: Oh, okay, time's up! 
Chandler: Oh that's not bad, Pheebs? 
Chandler: Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead invegetables,Joey? 
Chandler: Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list)There you go. 
Chandler: Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks upRoss' pad) 
Chandler: Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad) 
Chandler: I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up! 
Chandler: Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them,okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. 
Chandler: Okay, but if you can'tno dinner! 
Chandler: Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globein your apartment. 
Chandler: I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's likeold pumpkins or something. 
Chandler: Which smells delicious! 
Chandler: What? 
Chandler: Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue! 
Chandler: Huh! Where is the dog?!
Chandler: Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! 
Chandler: What is it doing here? 
Chandler: Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5minutes, my throat will just close up! 
Chandler: (gasping) Really? 
Chandler: Well, it still has to go, right?
Chandler: Okay, it's um
Chandler: (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say,"Do what you have to do") Okay, I hate dogs. 
Chandler: They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they arethinking, and that scares me a little bit. 
Chandler: (scared) Is there a puppy here? 
Chandler: (to Tag) Okay, you are new!
Chandler: Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. 
Chandler: And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, Idon't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (Anawkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!
Chandler: (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am. 
Chandler: How did youknow? (Heads back into the bathroom) 
Chandler: (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica? 
Chandler: Why not? 
Chandler: Well, I, I should go in there. 
Chandler: Why not? 
Chandler: This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom) 
Chandler: Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. 
Chandler: Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I,w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? 
Chandler: And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out) 
Chandler: No, no he went for a walk. 
Chandler: Please, please, please, don't be mad at me. 
Chandler: Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers.Yknow, for you, and(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must havegotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof,which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so,so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and thenover to the street) 
Chandler: Clunkers?! Oh my god! 
Chandler: (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you! 
Chandler: It's up to you. 
Chandler: All right. 
Chandler: You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey outof the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice. 
Chandler: Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
Chandler: Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)
Chandler: Okay. Okay.
Chandler: That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) Mydad gave me his old one.
Chandler: Hey! What are you guys doing? 
Chandler: Im sorry, who?
Chandler: But we dont know the neighbors.
Chandler: Wouldnt it be easier if we just moved?
Chandler: Eh, somebodys in a good mood!
Chandler: Well, either that or uh(Motions towards Joeys door.)
Chandler: (about to cry) Am not!
Chandler: Dont worry, Im brave! I am brave! II am brave! (Theyget to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through thedoor.) Can you tell me who is there please?
Chandler: (laughs) 4:00 A.M.
Chandler: I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!(Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.
Chandler: Mm! Night Gar! (Monica closes the door.)
Chandler: Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Chandler: Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Chandler: (with his mouth full) What happened? Im just eating candy.
Chandler: Absolutely! Yknow, because touchie can mean both ass and goodworker.
Chandler: What is the matter with you?
Chandler: Maybe, isnt she the woman who lives below you and has sex reallyloud?
Joey and Chandler: Yeah, thats her.
Chandler: Yknow what would work?
Chandler: Stop making candy!
Chandler: You mean they like you.
Chandler: Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Chandler: (asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on? 
Chandler: Joey!
Chandler: What are you doing?
Chandler: Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-LotLady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here!(Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.
Chandler: All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!!Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This womanwas trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get toknow all of you, and Ill bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Chandler: No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
Chandler: All right, yknow what? Forget it, all of you forget it!Youve ruined it! Go home! Youve ruined it! Youve ruined it!
Chandler: Youre welcome. (They kiss.)
Chandler: No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.Eh-uhare you okay?
Chandler: Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations atMichelles and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday seasonas a betroughed couple.
Chandler: betrothed couple.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Pheebs?
Chandler: Skull?
Chandler: How long have we been home?
Chandler: Lovely!
Chandler: Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonnachange your last name to Bing?
Chandler: Why not?
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Chandler: Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still beliving with him.
Chandler: No reason, exceptshetoldme.
Chandler: No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monicanow.
Chandler: Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Chandler: (to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?(Laughs.)
Chandler: Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Chandler: Is this because of the burrito thing?
Chandler: Give him money? It was a joke!
Chandler: Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Chandler: Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly)Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'dappreciate it. (Shakes his hand)
Chandler: Okay. (Walks back to Monica)
Chandler: Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with themoney in it)
Chandler: How do you know so much about this?
Chandler: Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Chandler: Mustached bastard
Chandler: (walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...
Chandler: (finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' hismoney, but he isn't there anymore)
Chandler: Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther'shand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely noteasier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is justhelping him to pick them up.) Thank you.
Chandler: Hey Pheebs!
Chandler: If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entirebuilding, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or avile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Chandler: (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Chandler: Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
Chandler: Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here,weirdturtle-man?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the moneyfalls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his handsweren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!
Chandler: You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santacostume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Chandler: Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Chandler: Santa? Really?
Chandler: Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Chandler: Then it's okay! (They kiss.)
Chandler: Because, if Santa and the HolidayArmadillo? (Ross nods) ...areever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Chandler: Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben,will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Chandler: My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out ofEgypt. (Glaring at Joey whos nodding.)
Chandler: Ohh. Mmm.
Chandler: Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Chandler: (nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sentit to us.
Chandler: Ino! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can'treturn a box after you've opened the box.
Chandler: Because it's too delicious.
Chandler: No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna sendaway for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecakeconglomerate, (Reading the label) Mommas Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible,Im a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Chandler: So
Chandler: Oh, whats at 8:00?
Chandler: Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannies made some new friends.
Chandler: I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then susheshim.)
Chandler: Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Chandler: I cant seem to say goodbye.
Chandler: Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Chandler: (closing the box) Yknow what? Forget it! We are justhungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunchand forget about the cheesecake.
Chandler: Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Chandler: Well, thank you for lunch.
Chandler: So apparently we just dont pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughsthen Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?
Chandler: Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)
Chandler: By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her tocome back to bad cheesecake.
Chandler: Well, we dont want that.
Chandler: But we should take it.
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecakeand they take off upstairs.)
Chandler: Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regretit.
Chandler: What are you doing tonight?
Chandler: Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)
Chandler: Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Chandler: Thats what Monica said.
Chandler: Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Chandler: I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries towhistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat thecheesecake without me?!
Chandler: Yknow what? I dont trust you with this cake anymore! And Igot it first, and Im takin it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for hisapartment.)
Chandler: Oh yes! 
Chandler: Oh yes!
Chandler: Oh yes! Oh yes!
Chandler: Well thats not fair, youve already had some!
Chandler: What do we use to split it?
Chandler: (examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. UhTheres more crust on this side. Yknow? So, maybe if I measured
Chandler: All right, Ill pick that one. (Points.)
Chandler: (gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!
Chandler: Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and dont comecrying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in thehallway and eat my (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor.That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that littlebit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.) 
Chandler: Stick to your side!
Chandler: (looking up with her) Thats a plane!
Chandler: (with a quivering voice) No, Im not!
Chandler: Because its flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come onMonica! (He goes inside.)
Chandler: (whispering) Monica!
Chandler: I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was DeepImpact and which one was Armageddon?
Chandler: Sorry, I justcant sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light andMonica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who wereice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time Ilook at that cover Im like(Fake snores.)
Chandler: What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed andheads into the living room.)
Chandler: Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) Im sorry, I thought maybe Idmake some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Chandler: It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Chandler: Hey, yknow what we can do? Yknow, now that we are up? Wecan just like talk to each other all night long, yknow like we did when we werefirst going out. Itd be fun!
Chandler: Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Chandler: (Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Chandler: Thats correct.
Chandler: (startled) What? What? What?
Chandler: Yeah! You?
Chandler: (intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope youre not thinkingabout cleaning the living room.
Chandler: Do you know what just happened?
Chandler: No. We were in the middle of sexand you fell asleep.
Chandler: (turning the light back on) Monica?
Chandler: I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So pleasewake up so we can do it right!
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Dont fall asleep! Okay,I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesnt move as he gets out of bed and ashes heading for the door.) And I probably wont spill coffee grounds all overthe kitchen floor.
Chandler: Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I cant believe thatIve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Chandler: Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have sevenminutes
Chandler: Do you wanna?
Chandler: Couldnt I just say, "This is Ross?"
Chandler: (knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
Chandler: Joey! Joe! (Sees that hes not here and starts investigating. Hepicks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beers still cold.Something terrible mustve happened here! (He decides its not thatimportant; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Ohno-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)
Chandler: My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out thedoor, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are comingup the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Yeah, Id love to but Ive tried that so many times theywont even let me in the store anymore.
Chandler: (excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that ismaking all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair ofthe Year?
Chandler: Thats awesome! Thats great! What made you do it?!
Chandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joeys chair?
Chandler: I thought I broke Joeys chair! Thats why I replacedit with mine!
Chandler: Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Chandler: Im gettin my chair back! (Heads for Joey andRachels.)
Chandler: Joey you broke my chair!!
Chandler: I think I should get the chair!
Chandler: Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points toRachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me!
Chandler: Well, wheres the logic in that?!
Chandler: So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Chandler: What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Chandler: (To Monica) Shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Chandler: No Rach, its not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainlywasnt that much fun.
Chandler: Ross, a sports car? Wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff asock down there?
Chandler: (To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monicas gonna be here anyminute!
Chandler: (frustrated) Okay, for the last time. Its not named for eachindividual man.
Chandler: Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I cant believe that youwould have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I cant believe thatyou would have a tux thats thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Gellersshoulder.)
Chandler: Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
Chandler: Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off thelights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from theassemblage.)
Chandler: (getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find outwhats going on.
Chandler: Hey-hey are you drunk?
Chandler: Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surpriseparty for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Chandler: Yes!
Chandler: Yes!!
Chandler: Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee andthey will never know that youre drunk.
Chandler: Yeah, Ill take care of it.
Chandler: (laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Chandler: Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surpriseparty. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on herparty dress.
Chandler: See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room,and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller whos sitting at the table and Mrs. Gellerwhos standing next to him.)
Chandler: (correcting her) Phil.
Chandler: Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on thesteps.) Okay, (catches her) youre doing great. Youre doing great. Youredoing fine.
Chandler: Monicas a little drunk.
Chandler: (To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesnt want her parentsto know shes drunk.
Chandler: Monicas wasted.
Chandler: (To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Chandler: Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Chandler: For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, readthe card! Read the card!
Chandler: No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Chandler: No, because youre not a grandmother!
Chandler: (to a waiter) Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some ofthat over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.
Chandler: (To Monica) How are you feeling?
Chandler: (To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bitmore, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone.
Chandler: Pheebs!!
Chandler: I think its necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Okay, here we go.
Chandler: Hey! Howd it go?
Chandler: Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Chandler: (To Ross) Monica said wedding.
Chandler: Do you think you could get through a poem?
Chandler: Too?
Chandler: Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-typemanner.)
Chandler: Thats great!
Chandler: So great things are happening at work and in your personallife!
Chandler: Dont do it.
Chandler: I think its the dying cat parade.
Chandler: (turning around and looking) Oh my God!
Chandler: Yknow that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He washanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "Youre halfScottish right?"
Chandler: Yes!!
Chandler: Why is your family Ross?!
Chandler: If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cooland the Gang.
Chandler: Well, I feel like a snack!
Chandler: Oh no thanks. I dont like any thing from my Scottishheritage.
Chandler: Well its just my entire family was run out of ScotlandbyVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)
Chandler: We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Chandler: Thats not really important right now. What is important is;while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for ourwedding.
Chandler: Because we hate them.
Chandler: We have heard you play.
Monica and Chandler: No!
Chandler: You mean the spitter?
Chandler: Easy for you to say; youll be wearing a veil.
Chandler: You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Chandler: Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say, "Ido," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!"
Chandler: Yeah!
Chandler: Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Chandler: We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I saylegitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Chandler: No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we werestill together.
Chandler: Joe
Chandler: (To Monica) Yknow, we havent found anybody else.
Chandler: Yeah you can do it.
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Our minister
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
Chandler: Yeah. O-okay.
Chandler: See Joe, not that thats not grrreat! But, one of the cool thingsabout having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!Yknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Chandler: No, not us (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)
Chandler: See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yknow, romanticstories. Nice stories.
Chandler: Joe?
Chandler: Isnt that what happened with you and the brides maid?
Chandler: And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room andsaid goodnight.
Chandler: But then later that night
Chandler: (answering the door) Hey!
Chandler: Well I was I was exactly expecting company after(He looksat his watch.) 9:15.
Chandler: Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with thebrides maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youre not still upset aboutwhat that guy told ya are ya?
Chandler: Well, look its been a really emotional time yknow, andyouve had a lot to drink. And youve just got to let that go okay? Imean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Chandler: You kidding? Youre the most beautiful woman in most rooms(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whats goingon? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Chandler: But we dont do that.
Chandler: How drunk are you?
Chandler: (thinks) Thats the perfect amount!
Chandler: What?
Chandler: I know.
Chandler: Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wannaget under the covers?
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Chandler: Yep!
Chandler: Count of three?
Chandler: Two!
Monica and Chandler: Three! (They lift up the covers and check each otherout, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)
Chandler: Well I think its safe to say that our friendship is effectivelyruined.
Chandler: Eh!
Chandler: Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the coversas Joey enters. Remember?)
Chandler: Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e (Notices that the TV isturned off.)
Chandler: No! No! No!
Chandler: Theyre in my bag over there. (Points.)
Chandler: Uh, could you leave me one?
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: No I-I-Im fine.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Chandler: (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you everin-intend on telling me about this?
Chandler: Oh, its not important? Its not important?! If itwasnt for a brides maid youd be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!
Chandler: I dont believe it. The most romantic night of my life andIm runner up.
Chandler: (To Joey) Look there is no way youre doing this wedding now.Okay?
Chandler: Okay, its just weird! Okay? I dont want to be standingtheir saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I needIdont know what I need. I need a walk.
Chandler: It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead youhad to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)
Chandler: Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me butit would probably rather sleep with you!
Chandler: Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding
Chandler: How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with thisfantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Chandler: Thats what you should say.
Chandler: When youre marrying us; thats what you should say.
Chandler: Id love it if you would do it.
Chandler: But those are the words! Those exact words!
Chandler: Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a littlebit and some things in life are more important.
Chandler: So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kingsthat were trying to get to play at the wedding?
Chandler: Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Chandler: Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?
Chandler: Do you want me to call?
Chandler: Staying out of the way.
Chandler: Sure! Thats one of the great things about being engaged.Im not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Chandler: (To Ross) Smooth.
Chandler: So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about themagical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Chandler: Huh.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Uh Joe, when its one oclock in the morning and youdont come by? Thats okay!
Chandler: Really? Right across the street?
Chandler: Whend you meet her?
Chandler: Excellent! Yknow Ross met somebody too!
Chandler: Hi! Howd it go?
Chandler: (sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were inRosss situation?
Chandler: So this is nice! I wish I didnt have to go, believe me! Butunfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way,whats the name the girl youre dating?
Chandler: Bye! (Exits.)
Chandler: Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroomto wash his hands.)
Chandler: (returning) What are you guys talking about?
Chandler: But I love swing music!
Chandler: Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! Andtheres another reason too.
Chandler: I dont want to say.
Chandler: Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them itwasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all mydances with.
Chandler: Hi, honey! Im home!
Chandler: Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Chandler: Yknow its funny I started it but, now its scary me.So could you come out here please?
Chandler: Oh you got a wedding dress? Thats great!
Chandler: Well then why cant I see it?
Chandler: Okay I promise. Ill-Ill hate it. (She enters.) Wow!You-you lookhideous.
Chandler: Yeah, thats like the most ugliest dress Ive ever seen.Wh-why do you to return it?
Chandler: Oh thats great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean itslike yuck! Its terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: (without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Chandler: Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.
Chandler: Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Chandler: Kinda. Theyre really big.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: No. No, see when I first meet somebody its uh its mostlypanic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Chandler: Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and Im afraid evenmore sweating.
Chandler: I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of ourrelationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna betogether for the rest of our lives.
Chandler: Well yeah! But now that I know that youre having these thoughts,Im back to panic, anxiety, and uh Im definitely gonna need some kind of sportsdrink.
Chandler: (hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleeptogether before the wedding.
Chandler: Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh webroke up for a few hours
Chandler: Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy anddomineering?!
Chandler: Thats me! Come on!
Chandler: Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Chandler: (transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!
Chandler: Ill be right with you.
Chandler: I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently.Its called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monicas eyes.)Say something.
Chandler: Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Chandler: This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Chandler: Yknow I think we should invite them.
Chandler: Well this is just sad!
Chandler: Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to knowthat I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Chandler: (sees another rack) Well, whats the deal with these? These-theselook nice.
Chandler: You mean like for award shows?
Chandler: You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with peopleyelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Chandler: Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)
Chandler: Not bad.
Chandler: Whos that?
Chandler: Pierce Brosnan?
Chandler: Are you serious?
Chandler: 007?! This is James Bonds tux?!
Chandler: Oh, I have to get married in James Bonds tux!
Chandler: Oh, its not just that, I would be Englands most powerfulweapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service. A man who fears noone; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?
Chandler: A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! JamesBonds tux!
Chandler: SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
Chandler: Please, dont take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Chandler: Look, its my wedding day okay? If you were getting married Iwould never do anything to upset you.
Chandler: That was pretty 007.
Chandler: Ross is Batman!
Chandler: Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batmanis so much cooler than James Bond!
Chandler: Batman has a utility belt!
Chandler: Batman has the Batmobile!
Chandler: Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?
Chandler: Actually, I dont like martinis.
Chandler: Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)
Chandler: I would but mine doesnt fit. The pants are a little tight.
Chandler: Well, does that mean that youre not going to wearing yours?
Chandler: (standing up) Let me try it on!
Chandler: (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Findssomething in the pocket) Whats this?
Chandler: An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! ValKilmer didnt wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruitylove story where he played a blind guy!
Chandler: The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.(Hands him the jacket and walks away.)
Chandler: Well, youre welcome. And tell them were really gladtheyre coming.
Chandler: (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!
Chandler: Whose is it?
Chandler: Whose is it?
Chandler: Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?
Chandler: Do you realize you get louder each week?
Chandler: I figured Id buy those. Pat, Id like to buy a vow.(Laughs)
Chandler: Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Chandler: Do you happen to know what Im going to say?
Chandler: (watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love memore than I love her! Whats wrong with me? Ooh, dont open that door.
Chandler: (writing) Monica, there are no words (To Joey and Ross) Thereare no words! This should not be this hard!
Chandler: Im so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! Youshouldve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Chandler: Yeah, Im not sure I can do that.
Chandler: (seeing her) Okay.
Chandler: All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man onEarth. Would you go out with me?
Chandler: (shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) Thats one?
Chandler: Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
Chandler: (writing) Monica
Chandler: (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?
Chandler: You'll get one.
Chandler: All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us aremarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Chandler: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Chandler: No, no, no.
Chandler: (trapped) Uh, uh.
Chandler: Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the backof the chair he was sitting in)
Chandler: Nice try.
Chandler: Look, Monica
Chandler: This is not going to work.
Chandler: You are so great! I love you!
Chandler: Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, Ijust stopped talking!
Chandler: No I didn't!
Chandler: No I didn't!
Chandler: No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Chandler:  Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Chandler: Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Chandler: Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Imsaying?
Chandler: Oh my God.
Chandler: Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God,I thought (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) Ithought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thingthat matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.(Starting to cry again.) And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my lifetrying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will youmarry me?
Chandler: I've had a very long, hard day.
Chandler: Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Chandler: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me aboutchicken.
Chandler: Hey Joe!
Chandler: Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke(Yelpsin pain as Monica grabs him underwater)Diet Coke.
Chandler: It happened in London.
Chandler: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make abig deal out of it.
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Chandler: (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel isabsolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
Chandler: (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriateand the pinching!!
Chandler: Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Chandler: Phoebe knows about us!
Chandler: Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Chandler: Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to putlotion on her! 
Chandler: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a littlemimic of her dance.)
Chandler: Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
Chandler: Oh, you're-you're going?
Chandler: (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm veryhappy were gonna have all the sex.
Chandler: Not if I kiss you first.
Chandler: Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Chandler: Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Chandler: Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Chandler: Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (Theywalk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
Chandler: Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Chandler: Who are those people?
Chandler: Whats going on?
Chandler: So we both finished our vows.
Chandler: Dont worry honey, well make yours funnier.
Chandler: Okay, what do you guys think?
Chandler: You really like it?
Chandler: I stole Monicas and changed the name.
Chandler: Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him aninvitation.
Chandler: I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not the close. Ihavent seen him in years.
Chandler: Well he doesnt have to know! Its not like we run in thesame circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Chandler: Trust me, you dont want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonnabe staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Chandler: Whats this?
Chandler: Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?!No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersThink of the money wellsave!! (Monica just looks at him.) Were not eloping. I love the flowers. Can ourwedding be bigger please?
Chandler: Yknow we already went over this and I won!
Chandler: Look forget it okay? I dont want to go. I dont want to seehim. I dont wanna.
Chandler: No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youdhave to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School,he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet.Yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. Youre skinny. Youre wearingspeedoesThat your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into thestands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearinga headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as ahealthy snack!
Chandler: He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Chandler: Does it matter?!
Chandler: Yeah o-okay, but Im just doing this for you.
Chandler: So I really never get to win anymore?
Chandler: Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)
Chandler: No! No! I dont want him to know were yet! Im notsure Im ready for that. And besides hes not gonna be too happy to see meeither.
Chandler: I dont know if Ive told you this, but hes kindatried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Chandler: Yeah, hes made phone calls, written letters, he even came to NewYork, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Yknow its all very Catsin the CradleI dont want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go.
Chandler: And theres daddy!
Chandler: Believe me, Ive been saying that for years. Oh my God!
Chandler: Thats Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
Chandler: Hes coming into the audience. Hes coming into theaudience.
Chandler: It cant happen like this. Okay? Ill meet you back at thehotel.
Chandler: (resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)
Chandler: Oh, theyre a hoot.
Chandler: Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Chandler: Wait! Wait! Wed really love it if you could be there.
Chandler: I know it would make me happy, maam.
Chandler: Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Chandler: (To Monica) When I was growing up Iplayed the one on the farleft.
Chandler: Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and themisses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Chandler: The young hot ball and chain.
Chandler: Whats up?
Chandler: Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. Imbuying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Chandler: But youre still my friend?
Chandler: During this timeare you, are you still my best man?
Chandler: Do I still call you Ross?
Chandler: (smiling) Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for thewarning.
Chandler: So are wefriends again?
Chandler: Okay. (Pause) You wont believe what Monicas olderbrother just said to me!
Chandler: (entering from the bedroom) Okay. Heres a question you neverhave to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearlnecklaces.
Chandler: Yes, include more people in this.
Chandler: Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Chandler: Well you dont have to sound so surprised.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Honestly? Me too.
Chandler: Yeah. Yknow I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna comeup and Ill go allChandler. But nothing has.
Chandler: Okay. Ill be right there.
Chandler: Were the Bings.
Chandler: Mr. and Mrs. Bing! (Walks away.)
Chandler: Hi.
Chandler: Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (Shes wearing atight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)
Chandler: Hidad.
Chandler: Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)
Chandler: How did you guys find me? I knew I shouldve hid at the gym!
Chandler: Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that Imrelated to Monica. How is she?
Chandler: No! No! No! I cant do that!
Chandler: Because if I go home, were gonna become the Bings! I cantbe the Bings!
Chandler: The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they usethe pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Chandler: No.
Chandler: Its not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look ateverybodys! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! AndIve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I dont race cars! I dont make popcorn!None of my proceeds go to charity.
Chandler: I want to. I love her so much, but Im afrIts toohuge.
Chandler: Well yeah, but then
Chandler: Depends on what you mean by we.
Chandler: No.
Chandler: Yeah okay. Well, whats the next little bit?
Chandler: Yeah. Youre right. Hey I-I can do that.
Chandler: Okay, excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)
Chandler: Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little freshair.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Oh fresh air!
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Ross! (He starts to get up.)

Chandler: Monicas pregnant.
Chandler: Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out ofcigarettes
Chandler: Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and thats when Iuh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.)Yeah, yknow what? I thought anything that can fit into this, cant be scary.
Chandler: But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to giveMonica so shed know I was okay.
Chandler: You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You lookbeautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) Im so glad youhere. (He kisses his mom.)

Chandler: (To Ross) No, thats okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica Ithought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when Isaw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprisesthat come our way its okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I wasmeant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if Im sure? (He leans in andkisses her.)

Chandler: Monicas gotta have the phone in the right placeand(Frantic babbling.)
Chandler: What?! What are you talking about?
Chandler: Whos the father?
Chandler: Why not?
Chandler: As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin?
Chandler: Yknow I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Chandler: Before we go out there Ive got a present for ya.
Chandler: No?
Chandler: Ive been taking dancing lessons.

Chandler: Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
Chandler: Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)
Chandler: What size shoes do you wear?
Chandler: Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dancefloor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Chandler: (looking at Joeys feet) Those arent eleven and a half.
Chandler: And the world will never know.
Chandler: Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days OfOur Lives.
Chandler: But youre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actorwith freakishly tiny feet.
Chandler: Did it turn into sand?
Chandler: (sliding up behind her) No. No, I wont. Do you know why I tookall those lessons? See, for the first time I didnt want you to be embarrassed to beseen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: (to the front desk clerk) Hi! Were checking out of the bridalsuite.

Chandler: Great.
Chandler: Hey! Did you find the cameras?
Chandler: Yes! And thats why Im under the table. Celebrating.
Chandler: Well this is great. Yknow, those cameras were the only thingthat was gonna cheer Monica up today, shes really depressed.
Chandler: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I cantbelieve I screwed this up!
Chandler: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
Chandler: Are you serious?

Chandler: Yknow who has a great video camera?
Chandler: Lets call em.
Chandler: Here you go. (Shows her the number again.)
Chandler: What?
Chandler: I dont know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all thoseinsightful, great questions.
Chandler: Yeah, were gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of themagree.)
Chandler: I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong.
Chandler: I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Chandler: Well maybe it was all of your questions.
Chandler: The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
Chandler: (angrily) Was that another question?
Chandler: Did you do it on our invitations?!
Chandler: So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framedinvitation down onto the table.)
Chandler: Thats the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
Chandler: Jenny! That is so Jenny!
Chandler: You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how Iget around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
Chandler: Whats funny about that?
Chandler: Hey thats okay. So, where do you want to go?
Chandler: The Hard Rock Café?
Chandler: Again?!
Chandler: You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.
Chandler: Yeah, he thinks thats my name.
Chandler: Oh its been going on way to long now. Yknow, I mean thefirst time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnt sayanything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" AndI-I wanted a donut. And now its five years later, the donuts gone and Imstill Toby.
Chandler: No! That would be so awkward! LookBesides, we work in differentdepartments. Hes on the sixth floor yknow? So he calls me Toby once in awhile. Whats the big deal? It could be worse, its not like hes callingme Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)
Chandler: Shh! It is a family name!
Chandler: Hey Bob.
Chandler: If I see him, Ill ask.
Chandler: Yeah!
Chandler: Were on a semi-first name basis.
Chandler: Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know ifhe has what it takes.
Chandler: But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here.
Chandler: I think its best sir.
Chandler: Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder andclaim you never got em.
Chandler: What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously aroundhere?!
Chandler: Sure, whats up?
Chandler: Hey Bobby.
Chandler: Uhh yeah. Yeah, its (Points down the hall) right, right downthere. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplateoff of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
Chandler: Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the jobup here.
Chandler: Bob!
Chandler: Well that puts me in a difficult position.
Chandler: (entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are youdoing?!
Chandler: Youre an actor!
Chandler: (entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica!Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume
Chandler: The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Chandler: No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
Chandler: How is that me?
Chandler: When have I ever done that?!
Chandler: Wow! I dont have the worst costume anymore!
Chandler: Oh! Hi!
Chandler: Joeys gonna be thrilled! He was hoping youd come by as aslutty nurse.
Chandler: Youd think that would embarrass me, but you see Im maxedout.
Chandler: (To Ross) Marry her.
Chandler: Howdy doody.
Chandler: Oh relax man, relax. Youre looking a little flushed.
Chandler: What question?
Chandler: Theres no question.
Chandler: (To Monica) You picked Ross?!
Chandler: I cannot believe you didnt pick me.
Chandler: Oh really?! You think youre stronger? Why dont you proveit? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)
Chandler: (To Ross) Youre going down.
Chandler: That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!
Chandler: And dignity.
Chandler: Nope! I can do this all day.
Chandler: God, Im exhausted.
Chandler: No way! If anything youve gotta let me win! My wife thinksIm a wimp!
Chandler: Youre Spudnik.
Chandler: Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no! 
Chandler: Listen, Ive got a secret for ya. I let him win.
Chandler: No, I let him winRoss!
Chandler: Would you tell her I let you win please?
Chandler: I am strong! Ill show you! (He sits down at the table.)
Chandler: Oh whats the matter? Are you scared?
Chandler: Okay. 123Go! (Once again hes at a stalemate,but this time hes in pain.) (Pause) Im gonna kill myself!
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Yknow uh, I didnt actually do this.
Chandler: No, it wasnt you.
Chandler: I got a maid. Yay!
Chandler: Uh honey, I know you dont like to relinquish control
Chandler: Look, shes really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adoredthe way that you arranged the sponges.
Chandler: Yes, I distinctly remember cause I thought it was a joke. Nowjust give her a chance, okay?
Chandler: Whats the matter?
Chandler: See? I told you.
Chandler: (pause) What?
Chandler: So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in frontof you?
Chandler: She mustve been planning this for years!
Chandler: Honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeansmade more than just the one pair?
Chandler: So, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before wegosnooping around her crotch?
Chandler: Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
Chandler: (entering) Hi!
Chandler: How come?
Chandler: To see her pants?
Chandler: Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
Chandler: God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
Chandler: Oh dear God!
Chandler: And yet you dont recognize that youre crazy.
Chandler: Heres another planNo!
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: I fear a jury will see it the same way!
Chandler: You see that?
Chandler: All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if its not your brawill you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
Chandler: You need new clothes.
Chandler: Im leaning. This is where I lean.
Chandler: Brenda a bee!
Chandler: Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo yourbuttons lest it sting you!
Chandler: You do?
Chandler: I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see yourbra?
Chandler: Her what?!!
Chandler: You had a bachelorette party?!
Chandler: I thought we werent gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties!Yknow, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
Chandler: You went home with the waitress.
Chandler: I cant believe you didnt tell me! You know that thetwo pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
Chandler: My God! You must be good in bed!
Chandler: Shes okay with Rachel and the baby?
Chandler: Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think thatyoure going down the same path, but youre really going down different ones.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Honey! Thats crazy! I dont want you to get me astripper
Chandler: Look, I appreciate it, but uh, its a little creepy. Yknow?Im not a bachelor anymore.
Chandler: All right fine! But Im only doing this for you!
Chandler: And Joey.
Chandler: Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
Chandler: I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelorparty?
Chandler: What are you doing?
Chandler: Okay. I cant believe tomorrows the big day.
Chandler: Youre right, this is more fun.
Chandler: Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)
Chandler: Thats me.
Chandler: Yeah, yeah right over there.
Chandler: That was weird.
Chandler: So shes a
Chandler: I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Chandler: Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missedit. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Maam, are you also a stripper?
Chandler: That is funny, maybe for my birthday shell murder someone.
Chandler: Oh actually, Id rather youYeah, go ahead. Were gonnahave to burn that room down anyway.
Chandler: Why would she do that?
Chandler: This is the worst bachelor party ever!
Chandler: (To Joey) In a minute? Whats gonna happen in a minute?!
Chandler: Why me?!
Chandler: Which is why you should do it.
Chandler: You do it!
Chandler: All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!(Joey smirks.) What?
Chandler: I dont think weve actually done this before!
Chandler: Well wewe still hang out.
Chandler: Well yknow, things are different. ImIm marriednow.
Chandler: Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on well maketime to hang out with each other.
Chandler: Her ass print is still on your grandmothers quilt, do you reallywant to talk about smoking?
Chandler: Monica! Wait!
Chandler: (puts on his crown) Carry on.
Chandler: Could you not narrate?
Chandler: I have no idea.
Chandler: Yeah! Im just pretending to watch the game so I dont haveto help out with stuff.
Chandler: Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV. 
Chandler: Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) Theres noAnderson.
Chandler: Oh hey. Id shake your hand but uh; Im really into thegame. Plus, I think itd be better for my ego if we didnt stand right next toeach other.
Chandler: Im watching the game, but Im not deaf!
Chandler: (To Phoebe) Yknow, its been a while since wevescreamed something. Maybe we should.
Chandler: Oh come on!
Chandler: Good game!
Chandler: Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
Chandler: (simultaneously) Detroit.
Chandler: Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphroditecheerleader from Long Island?!
Chandler: Im sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a50-year-old woman?
Chandler: Did she look 16?
Chandler: Well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spentmost of her life sitting for oil paintings!
Chandler: Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Chandler: New haircut? (Monica nods No.) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No)Boots? (Monica nods Yes.) Boots!
Chandler: Oh my God!
Chandler: Im gonna miss being able to afford food.
Chandler: She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.) 
Chandler: Yeah well, too bad were gonna have to return them.
Chandler: I have you.
Chandler: Hey-hey.
Chandler: You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money topay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)
Chandler: (returning to his seat) Hey!
Chandler: (spinning around looking for him) I dont think you did a verythorough job!
Chandler: (opening the door) Whats wrong?
Chandler: Oh dont forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They gointo the apartment.)
Chandler: Now sweetie, I know you dont like my office parties, but you canwear your new boots. See? Every cloud has asupple leather lining.
Chandler: Why not?
Chandler: Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Chandler: You said that you paid all that money because those boots go withskirts, dresses, and pants!
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Yknow, that party wasnt bad.
Chandler: I dont see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
Chandler: What honey, its like fifteen blocks to the subway. Letsgo.
Chandler: Whats going on?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause)Its oddly unsettling.
Chandler: Hop on.
Chandler: Honey, I know youre in pain right now, but Im a littleturned on.
Chandler: Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
Chandler: Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break?
Chandler: I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband.
Chandler: (pause) I dont have your boots.
Chandler: Well, why dont you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew ona bale of hay!
Chandler: Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
Chandler: Yknow what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Chandler: Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)
Chandler: Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
Chandler: I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Imsorry.
Chandler: No.
Chandler: Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpturedoesnt it?
Chandler: Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.
Chandler: Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
Chandler: Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.
Chandler: Well now-now youre just talking crazy.
Chandler: Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Holdme.
Chandler: Yknow what would really help me through this tough time ischoking something. Can I choke ya?
Chandler: Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell withthat bitch.
Chandler: Oh thats all right sir, and thats just one girl.
Chandler: Its a hand. Its a thing you use as a Jack and Cokeholder.
Chandler: Oh no-no-no!
Chandler: Hi honey Im home.
Chandler: It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him thatyou and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and thenwhen I wouldnt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
Chandler: Yknow what the worse part was? I got to see what my life wouldbe like without you. It was like Its a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Pleasepromise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with eachother for the rest of our lives.
Chandler: Ooh, I dont know if were there yet.
Chandler: Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
Chandler: Pheebs you didnt have to get us anything for our wedding youalready sang
Chandler: Oh, okay. 
Chandler: I kinda like it here.
Chandler: Well what did it do?
Chandler: A vending machine?
Chandler: Who cares? Its a stupid game.
Chandler: I dont suck. Its sucks. You suck.
Chandler: Why do you want to play this game so bad?
Chandler: You are not going to believe what I did today!
Chandler: I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! Theyshould change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they dont.
Chandler: Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off theboard! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he cantstraighten his fingers.)
Chandler: Well Ive been playing it for like eight hours, itll loosenup. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyre dirtywords.
Chandler: Because its awesome.
Chandler: Well yknow, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S itis a bit of a challenge.
Chandler: It is when you put it together with that one.
Chandler: Come on, he wont even know what they mean.
Chandler: Have you talked to him lately?
Chandler: No-no-no, if you unplug it, Ill have nothing to show for my day!It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look atthat! Look at that, its still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM(Read Only Memory, its a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!
Chandler: With the claw?!
Chandler: (smiles) Pull my finger(Looks at his hand)My hand ismessed up.
Chandler: I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.
Chandler: Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They bothlook at him.) Was it just me?!
Chandler: One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)
Chandler: All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
Chandler: Are you, are you high?
Chandler: Really? I dont like baths.
Chandler: Honey, its not the bath I enjoy, its the wet, naked lady.
Chandler: Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
Chandler: Honey, its 2:00 on a Wednesday and Im watching Road Rules,how stressed do you think I am?
Chandler: Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
Chandler: Oh my God, whats up?!
Chandler: Oh no-no, no you dont, just come back.
Chandler: Do you?
Chandler: In London?
Chandler: Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
Chandler: If that.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Sex on the balcony?
Chandler: What is it?
Chandler: Honey, I dont like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us havingsex on the balcony?
Chandler: Well, this does butch it up a bit.
Chandler: All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
Chandler: (thinking) All right, this isnt so bad. I like the flowersmell! Which is okay, because Ive got my boat.
Chandler: Oh my God.
Chandler: Im going to need a bigger boat.
Chandler: Im in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think theressomething wrong.
Chandler: Im in the bathtub.
Chandler: I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The waters tepid. The saltdidnt dissolve and is now lodged places. And the scents I used dontcompliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomileOh!
Chandler: The bath salts! Theyre starting to effervesce! Its different.(Pause) Its interesting.
Chandler: Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
Chandler: I had the exact same conversation.
Chandler: I dont know! Joey hasnt had this much trouble getting outwords since we saw him in Macbeth!
Chandler: All right, lets break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
Chandler: Uh-huh.
Chandler: He didnt say anything about that to me.
Chandler: He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, ofcourse the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
Chandler: But what did he mean by rules?
Chandler: Because he was looking at her differently.
Chandler: My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
Chandler: You dont say anything.
Chandler: Im not going to let you say anything.
Chandler: Oh, God!
Chandler: Do I smell essential oils?
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: L-leaving my troubles behind?
Chandler: Oh, its so hard to care when youre this relaxed.
Chandler: (upset) Hey!
Chandler: (To Monica) You told her?!
Chandler: (sarcastically) Because its a relaxing and enjoyable time!
Chandler: You like Rachel?!
Chandler: (sarcastically) Yes were all in here and we would love for you tojoin us!
Chandler: IllIll get you later!
Chandler: Yeah. And what youre doing feels so good.
Chandler: Youre not?
Chandler: Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
Chandler: Hey Pheebs, whats up?
Chandler: Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaningDont let Phoebe in.
Chandler: Well, Phoebe I thought Id(Off Phoebeslook)Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)
Chandler: Hey babe.
Chandler: Who says you cant get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks?Maybe we can take it back?
Chandler: How about to the street say from the balcony?
Chandler: Okay. How about in that cabinet?
Chandler: How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by thebathroom.)
Chandler: Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down andrelax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.)Its locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
Chandler: Oh yknow, Ive been living here a while and Ive neverseen whats inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
Chandler: Dont try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
Chandler: Fine.
Chandler: (walking casually away) Love you.
Chandler: Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for likethree years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said,"If it helps!" (Goes to the bedroom.)
Chandler: I wasnt trying to open your closet! I wasnt trying to openyour closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)
Chandler: Monica has a secret closet and she wont let me see whatsin it.
Chandler: I dont know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that Icant see?!
Chandler: Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Chandler: And here we go
Chandler: There has got to be a way!
Chandler: Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, Im not an nine-year-oldgirl.
Chandler: Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Chandler: So, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
Chandler: Thats a good idea.
Chandler: Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh,Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Chandler: Well, its not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her tothe hospital? Yknow? Youre doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboringan all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind thedoor.) Richard? If-if youre in there, could you pass me my credit card?
Chandler: Not to shabby, I got this all off myselfusing my wifestools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see whats behind thegreen door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!
Chandler: (laughs) Youre messy.
Chandler: I married Fred Sanford!
Chandler: No, honey youre not sick! Look, I dont love you becauseyoure organized, I love you in spite of that.
Chandler: Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying aroundcan we, can we share the closet.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: So Rachels all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Chandler: Are you okay?
Chandler: Happy Valentines!
Chandler: (picking up a video from the table) Candy and Cookie.Candy and Cookie? Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really mustlove me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some"porn")
Chandler: I love you, St. Valentine.
Chandler: Woah, woah, thats not pretty!
Chandler: Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons onthe remote control, frantically.)
Chandler: I am trying!
Chandler: (pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?
Chandler: Its yellingbleedingdilating. Oh, the dilating
Chandler: I thoughtmaybeyou got me porn for Valentines Day.
Chandler: Well, Im not really in a sexy mood right now.
Chandler: Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
Chandler: How long it took to go back in the water?
Chandler: You dont know. You didnt see it.
Chandler: Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks upthe remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks likehes going to throw up!)
Chandler: See, honey, theres(puts his hand on her leg)
Chandler: 90 seconds.
Chandler: You know, it haunts me? Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, wasmy father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make thatmy screensaver!
Chandler: I can do that.
Chandler: Okay. Now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.
Chandler: Oh, I know!
Chandler: Poor Ross.
Chandler: Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this hecloses the drapes!
Chandler: Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: dont watch it.
Chandler: Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone beingborn can make you want to kill yourself.
Chandler: (with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) Thisreminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they allsit down) Okay, here we go.
Chandler: Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Chandler: Wait, you guys, look!
Chandler: No, the babys out! Look, look!
Chandler: And look how happy the mom is now!
Chandler: Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) Shes growing inside you.
Chandler: Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)
Chandler: I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Chandler: Oh hey!
Chandler: No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for eachother and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I dont think they exist.
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Come on, dont be crazy. (To Rachel) You dont thinktheres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks athim.)
Chandler: A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Chandler: Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youretalking about.
Chandler: You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and yourestill gonna date him?
Chandler: (mouths to Phoebe) What?
Chandler: Whats wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.)On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still theres staring.) No?
Chandler: What are you doing?!
Chandler: I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Chandler: Cheese you say? Thats some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Chandler: Cheese, its smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Chandler: Is it made of cheese?
Chandler: (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?
Chandler: What do we do?
Chandler: Sure, why dont you set it up. Ill just be over here,browsing through the personals.
Chandler: Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Chandler: Im sorry, did you say cheese?
Chandler: Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I dont believe inthat kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wont stand inyour way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Chandler: No. But Im sure (mimics Don) tomatoes does.
Chandler: You dont?
Chandler: So youyou dont want to live with Don in a cheese house?
Chandler: I love you.
Chandler: Yknow what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. Ifound this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monicadoesnt look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: I dont see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?
Chandler: What?! No! No!
Chandler: (incredulous) I dont know what thats like?! Up until I was25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
Chandler: (interrupting him) We didnt play it!!
Chandler: I didnt know you read tea leaves.
Chandler: What does yours say Pheebs?
Chandler: Well, Im sure you get another one at Ann Taylors.
Chandler: Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!(Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does thatmean?
Chandler: I know its tough now, but things will get better.
Chandler: Im not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcasticcomment? Some cheese?
Chandler: Lets just say if I cant find the right CD case I just putit in the nearest one.
Chandler: In the James Taylor case.
Chandler: Honey, Im gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them inthe right case.
Chandler: Well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind oforder. Yknow alphabetically or by genre?
Chandler: They were just giving those away at the store (off Monicas look)in exchange for money.
Chandler: Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copiesof the Annie soundtrack.
Chandler: What problem did you tell him you had?
Chandler: (singing) The sunll come outtomorrow! Betyourbottom dollar that tomorrow (The girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) therellbe sun.
Chandler: You can always sell your baby.
Chandler: Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to showtheyre not in the baby buying business.
Chandler: Oh Im sorry, youre kicking me out of my own living room?
Chandler: Ill be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Chandler: Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who saidthat?
Chandler: And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Chandler: What are you doing?
Chandler: Its a dog.
Chandler: Its your parents anniversary and youre going to talkabout their dead pet?
Chandler: Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia,gingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.
Chandler: Ha!
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: I dont think the flash went off.
Chandler: Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a hugebutterfly net looking for that man.
Chandler: What are you doin?
Chandler: Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could(Punches the air).
Chandler: If only there was something in your head to control the thingsyou say. (Joey nods his agreement.)
Chandler: Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Chandler: No, were just four people with neck problems. You talk likethis. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)
Chandler: Nice work my friend.
Chandler: And a bagel with only
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think thecowboy hat is a little much?
Chandler: All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on abonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
Chandler: Yknow what, we have to turn off the porn.
Chandler: All right, ready?
Chandler: Two.
Chandler: Yeah, thats kinda a relief.
Chandler: You wanna see if we still have it?
Chandler: FREE PORN!!!
Chandler: We have free porn here!!!
Chandler: Whats wrong with you?
Chandler: This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to thedoctor!
Chandler: Thats still in there?!
Chandler: Stick to your side!
Chandler: Mento?
Chandler: Thanks.
Joey: How come you have two?Chandler: Well this one's for you.Joey: Get out.Chandler: No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and Ialso know that this is about more than just jewelry, (Puts bracelet on Joey) it's aboutyou and me and the fact that we're (Reading bracelet) best buds.Joey: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.Chandler: That's what they'll call us.[The next one is from Episode 618: The One Where Ross Dates A Student.]
Chandler: It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
Chandler: Youre turning into a woman.
Chandler: Now Ive upset you? What did I say?
Chandler: Oh my God, introduce us!
Chandler: Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
Chandler: Thats great.
Chandler: Youll be perfect for this! Thats already your name!
Chandler: Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
Chandler: Bamboozled?
Chandler: (simultaneously with Ross) No!
Chandler: Well Joey, Im a headhunter. I hook up out of work Sovietscientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)
Chandler: Bogota.
Chandler: What does a Wicked Wango card do?
Chandler: Higher or lower than what?
Chandler: (To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?
Chandler: This is ridiculous, hes not gonna hold his breath (Rosscuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)
Chandler: Let me see that.
Chandler: Triscadecaphobia.
Chandler: Fear of Triscuts?
Chandler: This game makes no sense!
Chandler: Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.
Chandler: Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care.
Chandler: Either, it makes no difference.
Chandler: Ill take a card.
Chandler: This game is kinda fun.
Chandler: I dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to eachother.
Chandler: Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Chandler: Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
Chandler: Id like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hutplease.
Chandler: Six!

Chandler: (annoyed) Oh come on!!
Chandler: Id like a Google Card.
Chandler: Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!
Chandler: Nooo!!
Chandler: This is the best game ever!!!
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Im so sorry.
Chandler: I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
Chandler: And people say you dont pay attention. No, this is a much betterjob. Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statisticalfactoring for other companies.
Chandler: Thats what I do now.
Chandler: The front page? You really do live in your own little world,dont ya?
Chandler: (entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!
Chandler: Well, I got a job interview. Its kinda a big deal too. Its a lotmore money and Id be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
Chandler: Me! I do that. So Seriously, do I look okay? Im littlenervous.
Chandler: Why not?
Chandler: What about it?
Chandler: (shocked) What?!
Chandler: Are you serious?!
Chandler: What is it that I do?
Chandler: (To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?
Chandler: I cant even believe this! I really come off that badly?
Chandler: Oh good. Good, because Im sure this interview is gonna last acouple of weeks.
Chandler: An hour.
Chandler: Phoebe!
Chandler: Chandler Bing.
Chandler: Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) Ill let myself out.
Chandler: I think youll find if I come to work here, I dontmicro-manage. I dont shy away from delegating.
Chandler: (suppressing a smile) What I do dois manage to uh, create anatmosphere of support for the people working with me.
Chandler: Hardest thing Ive ever done in my life.
Chandler: Oh! (Stands up.)
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: also I was the point person on my companys transition fromthe KL-5 to GR-6 system.
Chandler: That I did. That I did.
Chandler: (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.
Chandler: (trying not to laugh) I see.
Chandler: (really try not to laugh) Good to know.
Chandler: No dont I beg of you!
Chandler: (relieved) Really?!
Chandler: Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. YknowIve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hardto sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesnt understand) Duties. (Stilldoesnt.) Duties! (Still doesnt.) Poo. (Still doesnt.)
Chandler: Oh my God this doesnt count! Okay? The interview was over, thatwas the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Callsecurity! Theres a crazy guy out in the hall!
Chandler: Ill look forward to your call. (Walks away.)
Chandler: Lets. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)
Chandler: Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Chandler: Hes not snoozing, hes teaching a class.
Chandler: I havent seen this dress.
Chandler: You really want to take me?
Chandler: So youre never actually going to pay me back?
Chandler: I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you.
Chandler: (in a manly voice) Yeah well, Im gonna go spit. (He goes intothe bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)
Chandler: This is so exciting! Its so glamorous! People taking ourpicture. How do I look?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Its just so glamorous.
Chandler: Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
Chandler: Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
Chandler: The whole thing! Can we go?
Chandler: I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
Chandler: I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Chandler: Dont go! Im sorry. Im so sorry! (Sees another guywho is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!(Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.
Chandler: Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! Istill feel so bad!
Chandler: Im so sorry.
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: You dont owe me anything, I dont want you money
Chandler: I dont know, five hundred dollars?
Chandler: Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
Chandler: Do you want a calculator?
Chandler: Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he wasright.)
Chandler: Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tapclasses
Chandler: Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that playwhere you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came outJamaican. 
Chandler: Yes, money well spent!
Chandler: Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food
Chandler: Hi!
Chandler: Man, if only youd gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares athim.)
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Okay. Ive been thinking about it too, and I, I think wereready.
Chandler: But you said you were ready too.
Chandler: Yes, but havent you wanted a kid like forever?
Chandler: Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us.
Chandler: Look, weve always talked about having babies someday. Imnot saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it.Were good. Were really good.
Chandler: But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Chandler: What?! Its not right! Were not ready to have a kid now!!
Chandler: Im kidding. This is going to be fun.
Chandler: Were trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandlerstops it.) Yknow Im not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies.So, when do you want to start trying?
Chandler: Period math?
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: Right here?
Chandler: Wait a minute, its perfect. We got a lot of time to kill andwere in a building thats full of beds!
Chandler: Okay. (They start kissing.)
Chandler: Okay. Uh, well dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to thelight switch and finds its not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Orturn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays anaerosol air freshener above her.)
Chandler: Yes, 98.6. Youre gonna be fine.
Chandler: Should we tell Rachel theres an empty private room right nextdoor to hers?
Chandler: Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
Chandler: If its not, then theres two of them. And that would meanits the end of the world!
Chandler: Hi.
Chandler: Weirdest thing. Did I hear(A nurse opens the privacy screen andChandler sees Janice)Mother of God its true!
Chandler: Jan-Janice!
Chandler: Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos theunwitting human whos essence youve stolen?
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Chandler: Its incredible, I mean one minute shes inside you and then47 hours later here she is.
Chandler: So, do you know what youre gonna call her yet?
Chandler: So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
Chandler: You do?
Chandler: Oh no, its gonna be named after some snack or baked goodisnt it?
Chandler: That was amazing.
Chandler: And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
Chandler: He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Chandler: Okay. Wow.
Chandler: Sure.
Chandler: That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Chandler: What?! Why does she think that?
Chandler: Again, what?!
Chandler: As we all are at some point during the day.
Chandler: Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Chandler: And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much heloves to propose!
Chandler: Well, what did she say?
Chandler: Does Ross know?
Chandler: Well maybe you dont have to tell him anything.
Chandler: If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out,but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
Chandler: Honey, weve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Chandler: Im so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but noforeplay.
Chandler: Hello sir, you know Monica.
Chandler: Look, we cant stay in here forever.
Chandler: This is okay. Were all adults here; theres nothing to beashamed of. Now, lets put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (Theydo so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)
Chandler: I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, thatwasnt for fun.
Chandler: (To Monica) Why? Why-why-would youWh-why (To Mr. Geller)Look, I just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever wewant.
Chandler: Thats funny, this conversations how I got the bullet holein my head.
Chandler: Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
Chandler: You still havent told Rachel you werent really proposing?
Chandler: Joey, you have to tell her whats going on! And what did it looklike?!
Chandler: Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Chandler: Okay, look, just do it gently.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
Chandler: No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to theoffice (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?
Chandler: Couldnt sleep last night you know, then I started worrying aboutthis big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the moreI couldnt sleep.  Yknow? I was like, if I fall asleep now Ill getsix hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now Ill get five hours sleep. Not matter whatI did I couldnt fall asleep.
Chandler: Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
Chandler: Walter (nods).
Chandler: Yep.
Chandler: (not knowing what hes saying yes to) Yes.
Chandler: (enters) Hey.
Chandler: Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Chandler: Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
Chandler: Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Parisfor a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take apicnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
Chandler: Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris ofOklahoma?
Chandler: People whove never ever been to Paris.
Chandler: Were moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)
Chandler: Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me tomove to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently,said yes.
Chandler: The Sooner State, whatever that is.
Chandler: Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With AFringe On Top.
Chandler: No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monicasnot impressed.) Ill get out of it.
Chandler: (hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?
Chandler: Umm maam, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in)I kind of have some bad news. I dont think I can move to Tulsa.
Chandler: Its a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep inthe meeting this morning so when I said Id move to Tulsa, I didnt really knowwhat I was saying.
Chandler: But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting,aint that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, heres thething. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wont go. See, me, I loveTulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is ItalyPlease dont make me gothere!
Chandler: No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would Iwhen your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares athim.) Thats a picture of your daughter, isnt it, well shes lovely. Ilike a girl with a strong jaw. Ill call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)
Chandler: (entering, loudly) Hey!
Chandler: Oh so there cant be any yelling.
Chandler: Were moving to Tulsa
Chandler: Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) Icant, I cant hear you. (He runs out)
Chandler: (enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?
Chandler: Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head  up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
Chandler: They said it could be up to a year.
Chandler: There is nothing like the support of your loving  wife, huh?
Chandler: I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be  able to make it.
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: (Enters) Hey!
Chandler: I've got good news!
Chandler: Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa.  You can stay here and keep your job. 
Chandler: I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa. 
Chandler: Hey, you said that without gagging!
Chandler: I know what she's talking about.
Chandler: He saw a therapist?
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Chandler: Slim Pickings.
Chandler: No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.  They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're  looking for someone to shovel mesquite. 
Chandler: 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Chandler: Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming  with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.  'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Chandler: Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got  a lot of packing to do.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: How far outside?
Chandler: And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before  you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now  it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job. 
Chandler: What happened to 'you can't live without me four  days a week'?
Chandler: I think you should take the job.
Chandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you  start chattering like a monkey.
Chandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
Chandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer  in your touchy?
Chandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Chandler: Well, you got here just in time. I really have  to go buddy. (They hug)
Chandler: Of course I will call you. I love you.
Chandler: Awww. (They hug) Bye!
Chandler: (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the  matter Joe?
Chandler: Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make  all this easier?
Chandler: Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
Chandler: I know.
Chandler: I know that too. (They kiss)
Chandler: (On cell phone) Don't worry, I'll be back before  you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.
Chandler: (enters singing) Oklahoma where the wind comes  sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas?  7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym (sits down) who am I kidding pay-per-view  porn.
Chandler: DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica: (smiles)
Chandler: everything's great, just watching some regular  television there, what a pleasant surprise. (She hugs him, and she knows what  he was doing so she looks at the TV and sees sharks swimming around thinking  Chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)
Chandler: Ok honey. that was close.
Chandler: Hi honey I'm home!
Chandler: oh it was great.
Chandler: well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because  it's six o clock IN NY.C!
Chandler: (Chandler looking confused) Honey why am I watching  a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Chandler: no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie  that's all.
Chandler: does what always have to be sharks.
Chandler: What's going on?
Chandler: let ME be a part of this!
Chandler: no they don't
Chandler: OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel,  I was just watching regular porn
Chandler: yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American  action.
Chandler: You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really  you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you  find the strength and understanding over something like that.
Chandler: Good morning everyone, its nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?
Chandler: (laughs) Well, dont believe everything you hear, Ken. (both turning away to files) But yeah, thats true. Alright, lets get started, by take a look at last quarters figures. (The female next to Chandler starts smoking, towards her:) Ah, Claudia, arent you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses ass?
Chandler: No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I cant remember why. (to everyone:) Youre not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
Chandler: Alright, lolook. I dont smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, its fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke then? Thats almost rude, that Im not.
Chandler: (loud) Ken, please! No, I cant, I cant smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
Chandler: I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cigarette)
Chandler: Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
Chandler: No! I just happened tdo a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
Chandler: Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Chandler: Pheebs?
Chandler: (getting in) Okay, something to cover the smell  Oven cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) Unscented!
Chandler: No thanks, Im good.
Chandler: (shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so Im feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
Chandler: (still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
Chandler: Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two packaa carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many cigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) But its over, I made a decision, Im not gonna smoke anymore.
Chandler: But, those are for you.
Chandler: I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
Chandler: Will power? Ive watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.
Chandler: kay, look: Can we just drop this? Im not gonna smoke again.
Chandler: You forbid me?
Chandler: You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
Chandler: Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
Chandler: Then, I might as well  (grabs the cigarettes) do this (lights one, exhales). Not really sure what to do now.
Chandler: Fine. What!?
Chandler: You serious? (follows)
Chandler: Right, fine, Ill do it, but no talking.
Chandler: And no kissing your neck.
Chandler: And lots of kissing your neck.
Chandler: Look, I cant do this. I cant make luv to you while were fighting this way.
Chandler: That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, Im not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Chandler: Mean it?
Chandler: You are incredible. Unless, IIm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)
Chandler: Yeah, lets celebrate life!
Chandler: Uhh. You are welcome.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettesno big deal.
Chandler: Leave it.
Chandler: You tricked me to get me into bed?
Chandler: I feel so used.
Chandler: I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Chandler: I suppose that Monica will have the  manipulative shrew.
Chandler: You mean the lully story?
Chandler: Oh yeah, thats what she says. But maybe youre not ovulating at all, maybe its just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
Chandler: (to Joey) You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
Chandler: Whats the matter with me? Why Im such a girl?
Monica &amp; Chandler: Mhum.
Chandler: So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
Chandler: Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our  wedding china today?
Chandler: Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint. 
Chandler: What is the point of having them if we never use  them?
Chandler: I will explain it to her.
Chandler: Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo  hoo!  TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap  Days of Our Lives .
Chandler: Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime  soap Days of Our Lives? 
Chandler: What are you going to do?
Chandler: Well you proved them wrong.
Chandler: I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives,  I'll be careful until told otherwise. &lt;looks at china&gt; hey wait a minute  this isn't the china we picked out.. 
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?&lt; Phoebe comes in&gt;
Chandler: I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma. 
Chandler: You know, guys I got to say. This means so much  to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica  and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts  about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... &lt;starts  to cry&gt;
Chandler: No, if crazy plate lad.. &lt;sees Monica frustrated  at this comment&gt; If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
Chandler: Actually what? 
Chandler: What?
Chandler: So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough  to raise Emma? 
Chandler: Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent?  Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! 
Chandler: Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do  you really think I'm not capable? 
Chandler: Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die &lt;knocks  on table&gt;  she'd have to give her up. 
Chandler: So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends  die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left  in my life gets taken away from me?
Chandler: Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise  poorly? 
Chandler: Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong  father figure and I never will be. 
Chandler: Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said  was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody  knows it. 
Chandler: Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go  to your room! You're grounded"? 
Chandler: You said that to me last week. 
Chandler: Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't  know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I  want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. 
Chandler: Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and  you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't  be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones  I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize  to her right now. 
Chandler: Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize  to each other and mean it. 
Chandler: By the way, that fight was totally arousing. 
Chandler: Oh yeah? Well thanks. 
Chandler: Okay, but you should know he eats five times a  day and shoves pennies up his nose. 
Chandler: Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent  and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there  Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. &lt;knocks over the box of  china&gt; Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
Chandler: Nope...
Chandler: Yep...
Chandler: Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna...  put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should  use these plates again for a looong time.
Chandler: Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)
Chandler: (coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Chandler: Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
Chandler: So, who does?
Chandler: I'm sorry, I won't be here.
Chandler: Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day.
Chandler: Did I not mention that?
Chandler: (thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! (and runs out of the apartment)
Chandler: All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
Chandler: Hey. Where've you been?
Chandler: (to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
Chandler: Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
Chandler: Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
Chandler: I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
Chandler: Haha, no thanks!
Chandler: Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
Chandler: Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
Chandler: I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Chandler: What? That's terrible!
Chandler: Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
Chandler: No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Chandler: No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Chandler: If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Chandler: OK, Pheebs, your turn.
Chandler: And, a lemon lime.
Chandler: And last but not least.
Chandler: (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Chandler: Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
Chandler: Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Chandler: Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Chandler: Santa? Really?
Chandler: Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Chandler: Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)
Chandler: You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
Chandler: Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
Chandler: Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?
Chandler: Ah. Thanks.
Chandler: Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.
Chandler: Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
Chandler: Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
Chandler: It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Chandler: I sent them home.
Chandler: Uhh, uh...
Chandler: I don't know!
Chandler: I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
Chandler: Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
Chandler: BE-LOW me!
Chandler: Well, she... she didn't win...
Chandler: Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
Chandler: Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
Chandler: I'm serious!
Chandler: Merry Christmas.
Chandler: Merry Christmas, you guys!
Chandler: (hanging up the phone) The wife says "Hi!".
Chandler: Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
Chandler: This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
Chandler: Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)
Chandler: I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
Chandler: (flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!
Chandler: I'm *happily* married.
Chandler: Right. So, I'm sorry...
Chandler: Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
Chandler: I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
Chandler: You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Chandler: But we don't do that.
Chandler: How drunk are you?
Chandler: (thinks) That's the perfect amount!
Chandler: What?
Chandler: I know.
Chandler: Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Chandler: Yep!
Chandler: Count of three?
Chandler: Two!
Chandler: Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Chandler: Eh! (They start making out again)
Chandler: So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Chandler: Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
Chandler: Really? Okay, so...
Chandler: Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Chandler: Right!
Chandler: Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Chandler: Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
Chandler: Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
Chandler: I don't think so.
Chandler: (looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
Chandler: No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Chandler: Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
Chandler: Ehh.
Chandler: Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Chandler: Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Chandler: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Chandler: Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Chandler: Sure you do.
Chandler: You sure?
Chandler: I love you so much.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Chandler: Monica.
Chandler: I never want to leave you again!
Chandler: Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Chandler: Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
Chandler: (realizing) I have *not* thought this through!
Chandler: I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
Chandler: Thanks!
Chandler: (flattered) Ahh...
Chandler: (to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)
Chandler: I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
Chandler: I don't have a *job*!
Chandler: Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica:) Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
Chandler: Hey
Chandler: Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
Chandler: I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice   - not helping.
Joey and Chandler: (start to sing) Hey! Happy birthday ...
Joey and Chandler: Hi.
Chandler: Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
Chandler: Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Chandler: Now that Rachel's gone?
Chandler: I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Chandler: Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Ross, Joey and Chandler: Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
Chandler: Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Chandler: You don't trust him?
Chandler: Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?   Because I could get a job any day now.
Chandler: Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know   as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,   he's going to have sex with it.
Chandler: Picturing that tree?
Chandler: Where you going, Joe?
Chandler: Oh. You mind if I join you?
Chandler: Your thoughts? Plural?
Chandler: I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Chandler: Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Chandler: Great novels? 
Chandler: (In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
Chandler: (still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the   door) 
Ross and Chandler: Come on! Joe!
Chandler: (sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)
Chandler: (normal voice) Hi
Chandler: Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?
Chandler: Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
Chandler: No!
Chandler: Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"
Chandler: So are you gonna...talk to her?
Chandler: You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
Chandler: No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
Chandler: Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Chandler: Why did I get married?!
Chandler: Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
Chandler: Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
Chandler: What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Chandler: Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
Chandler: Did she go out with him?
Chandler: Ah! The high road...
Chandler: Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Chandler: I thought I had to make the jokes!
Chandler: Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
Chandler: We still got it!
Chandler: I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed
Chandler: By drowning or...?!
Chandler: Well...
Chandler: Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
Chandler: I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
Chandler: It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Chandler: Ok. First of all, this is green!
Chandler: All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
Chandler: Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his “business” partners.
Chandler: Yeah, well, I guess you don’t need my help Victor Victoria!
Chandler: Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
Chandler: And done!
Chandler: Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Chandler: Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
Chandler: No problem.
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: I am sorry I am late. You’ll understand when you’ll see Joey.
Chandler: Really? In front of all this people?
Chandler: Oh my God!
Chandler: Are those my wife’s nipples?
Chandler: I gotta stop this.
Chandler: You, touching yourself, out!
Chandler: “Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine.” So you just touch yourself for anything?
Chandler: See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married?      I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll      excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
Chandler: Wow.
Chandler: Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I      mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Chandler: Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
Chandler: No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go.      Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
Chandler: I don't do that.
Chandler: I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
Chandler: Today is the sixth.
Chandler: Yes, it's also 2003.
Chandler: It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Chandler: Tough crib.
Chandler: I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
Chandler: I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
Chandler: Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not. 
Chandler: I - I don't think I can.
Chandler: Because of Emma.
Chandler: Sorry.
Chandler: Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start...      canoodling in it.
Chandler: Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front      of the B-A-B-Y.
Chandler: Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
Chandler: You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you      wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through      the window.
Chandler: Emma was doing it!
Chandler: Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
Chandler: I think we may have really done it this time.
Chandler: You may wanna get some more of those too.
Chandler: Where's Emma?
Chandler: Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Chandler: Okay. (Runs out.)
Chandler: All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's      ovulating.
Chandler: No, no, no.
Chandler: What? Why?
Chandler: Your family name is Tribbiani.
Chandler: Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Chandler: I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Chandler: Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
Chandler: You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal  out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next  month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's  refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing  soda and beer?
Chandler: No! We're not borrowing money.
Chandler: Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing  my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool  house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Chandler: That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through  this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
Chandler: Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Chandler: Yes dear.
Chandler: Hey Joe!
Chandler: Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything  about it.
Chandler: And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica  and I are having a little financial trouble.
Chandler: What? What do you mean you know?
Chandler: Oh! Right.
Chandler: Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
Chandler: Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins  writing a cheque)
Chandler: Oh ok.
Chandler: I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she  wouldn't tell me about?
Chandler: Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Chandler: Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing  I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two...  single things.
Chandler: No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
Chandler: Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.  I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more  specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
Chandler: I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would  you? Don't answer that.
Chandler: Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change  a thing. Not a thing.
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: But honey you don't have to.
Chandler: Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Chandler: your ass?!?!?
Chandler: They...do that?
Chandler: God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Chandler: Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get  on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Chandler: (sedated) What?
Monica, Rachel, Chandler: It's over/Joe!
Chandler: Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow  hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets  really tricky.
Chandler: Aaaaand....... hernia.
Chandler: Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with  this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. (they hug again)
Chandler: Hey! Ready to go?
Chandler: What are you doin'?
Chandler: Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
Chandler: The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Chandler: Bet she'd sleep with you now... 
Chandler: Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... " (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
Chandler: Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
Chandler: Oh, I'm so sorry!
Chandler: You're not gonna need my help?
Chandler: Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)
Chandler: I believe I read that somewhere!
Chandler: I respectfully disagree.
Chandler: Who cares? Nobody reads those things
Chandler: I don't have a page.
Chandler: Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Chandler: Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Chandler: Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).
Chandler: Oh, you'll see my friend.
Chandler: (faking sympathy) And so young.
Chandler: Well, how you died was funny.
Chandler: It kills over one americans every year.
Chandler: You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Chandler: Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
Chandler: Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
Chandler: No, come on, you know that's not true.
Chandler: Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
Chandler: Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
Chandler: Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
Chandler: Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Chandler: Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
Chandler: There you go! Someone came!
Chandler: (in a mournful voice) Please, come in.
Chandler: Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
Chandler: At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
Chandler: Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Chandler: (entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)
Chandler: Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)
Chandler: Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
Chandler: You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
Chandler: Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Chandler: I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)
Chandler: Kori? Kori Weston?
Chandler: Wow! You look amazing!
Chandler: Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
Chandler: Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)
Chandler: I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Chandler: I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
Chandler: Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300million? No thank you!
Chandler: Still on Amelia Earhart?
Chandler: Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to getstruck by lightning 7 times.
Chandler: (looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross)Boohaki?
Chandler: Kinda like Joey.
Chandler: Pie eating contest?
Chandler: No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Chandler: (hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'llget it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)
Chandler: (into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
Chandler: (still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me whenyou know more.
Chandler: One of the slots got filled.
Chandler: Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
Chandler: Yeah I know.
Chandler: Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wannaget one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't careabout Charlie.
Chandler: I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friendfilled with regret eats own arm".
Chandler: Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we canprint whatever we want.
Chandler: Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do ifwe win?
Chandler: Ooh! Calm down ...
Chandler: You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way togo.
Chandler: You're right, it has been you dream for over 15seconds.
Chandler: (looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh... Mommy?
Chandler: Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody elsehear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept withhim!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)
Chandler: Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
Chandler: He's the boss's son.
Chandler: What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
Chandler: Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
Chandler: Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
Chandler: (to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have boughttickets just for us ...
Chandler: Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, itdoesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to haveprinciples, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets fromRachel)
Chandler: Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Chandler: Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things aregetting squished...
Chandler: (looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's twomessages. These could be from work!
Chandler: Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)
Chandler: This is..shhh!
Chandler: Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
Chandler: Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.(pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130chances to win, right?
Chandler: I got that!
Chandler: No.
Chandler: Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'mnot used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from thesofa) Hey, Steve.
Chandler: Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant!Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm nottoo mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
Chandler: Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
Chandler: Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see youtomorrow (hangs up).
Chandler: What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a juniorcopywriter.
Chandler: Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Chandler: Thanks, man.
Chandler: Really? What?
Chandler: (smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards thekitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heartright out.
Chandler: Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years orgo for the big payout.
Chandler: Me too.
Chandler: (To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
Chandler: What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!
Chandler: So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Chandler: Are you really that busy?
Chandler: Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?"
Chandler: (on the phone) "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" (pause) "Oh, thank you very much!" (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
Chandler: I don't have travel insurance.
Chandler: Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
Chandler: New York.
Chandler: I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
Chandler: Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
Chandler: Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
Chandler: Just give us the cheapest room you have.
Chandler: That's insane!
Chandler: Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.
Chandler: (aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Chandler: Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
Chandler: Dude, you're shaking!
Chandler: USA Today
Chandler: And I also got... two more apples.
Chandler: I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Chandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.
Chandler: Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?
Chandler: Yes, but the batteries...
Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!
Chandler: No!
Chandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away.
Chandler: There's a forest right outside.
Chandler: Ok, go quick!
Chandler: I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)
Chandler: (browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
Chandler: I could fall asleep at a play.
Chandler: (browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
Chandler: (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Chandler: Where the hell is everybody?
Chandler: (To himself) oh yes, God yes!!
Chandler: I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
Chandler: (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?
Chandler: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Chandler: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.
Chandler: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
Chandler: Did somebody sign your bra?
Chandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Chandler: Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).
Chandler: I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?
Chandler: (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?
Chandler: Oh, yeah?
Chandler: Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the   table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)
Chandler: We really need to take those tests?
Chandler: But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Chandler: It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Chandler: (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause)   And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
Chandler: Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than   on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Chandler: Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
Chandler: I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I   know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Chandler: Deposit my specimen? You know,   usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind   of talk. Thanks, got it.
Chandler: Yeah, I guess!
Chandler: Oh, Come on!
Chandler: Why are you here?
Chandler: (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is   she here??
Chandler: What!?
Chandler: I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got   a hot date... (starts to leave)
Chandler: (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)
Chandler: (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the   room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.   Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees   Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?
Chandler: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Chandler: I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...   I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
Chandler: (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there   is a reason why we can't have a baby?
Chandler: (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe   I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...   come here and do... 'that'...
Chandler: (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a "Wendy's!!   "
Chandler: (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited   his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
Chandler: Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here   but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile   fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause)   Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)
Chandler: Doctor Connelly just called.
Chandler: Actually it's both of us.
Chandler: Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable   environment.
Chandler: It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers   and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It   means...
Chandler: (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's   a good chance this may never happen for us.
Chandler: I'm sorry.
Chandler: Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
Chandler: (looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
Chandler: Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
Chandler: Hi.
Chandler: Oh, DAMN IT!
Chandler: Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
Chandler: (entering) Hey guys!
Chandler: I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
Chandler: But you come first!
Chandler: (sitting down on the couch) Ok.
Chandler: Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Chandler: Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
Chandler: (stopping Joey) ah-ha!
Chandler: I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Chandler: Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
Chandler: You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
Chandler: (to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
Chandler: So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Chandler: Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
Chandler: No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
Chandler: I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
Chandler: Ok!
Chandler: (bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!
Chandler: So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
Chandler: You don't like him.
Chandler: Alright! Just follow my lead!
Chandler: Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
Chandler: (very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Chandler: You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an "ok" sign)
Monica &amp; Chandler: Sure! Alright...
Chandler: I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
Chandler: (Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!
Chandler: You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Chandler: Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
Chandler: Ok.
Chandler: I think we've found our sperm!
Chandler: Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
Chandler: Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
Chandler: Yeah, he's better!
Chandler: Really? Are you sure?
Chandler: (sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
Chandler: So you know this leaves us with...
Chandler: How do you feel about that?
Chandler: Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Chandler: (smiling) Yeah.
Chandler: We are gonna be great parents.
Chandler: Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
Chandler: Hey, Zack!
Chandler: Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
Chandler: You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
Chandler: Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
Chandler: Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
Chandler: (upset) She does?
Chandler: I wouldn't read too much into it.
Chandler: David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
Chandler: Seriously, we're gonna do this?
Chandler: Oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: I didn't mean now...
Chandler: Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
Chandler: David, I'm pretending to read here!!
Chandler: (smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats) "I do".
Chandler: David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Chandler: Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Chandler: I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
Chandler: Man, that's some bad advice!
Chandler: That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Chandler: Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!
Chandler: (slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)
Chandler: Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)
Chandler: David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Chandler: That would be advice!!
Chandler: Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
Chandler: (offended) What? (pause) May I?
Chandler: (at the laptop) Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
Chandler: Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
Chandler: It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Chandler: Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Chandler: Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
Chandler: Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Chandler: It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
Chandler: Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
Chandler: I just feel awful.
Chandler: Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)
Chandler: (pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Chandler: Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
Chandler: And there's not chance that will work?
Chandler: (pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Chandler: This vacation sucks!!
Chandler: You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
Chandler: I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
Chandler: I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
Chandler: Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
Chandler: I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
Chandler: Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Chandler: Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Chandler: (to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.
Chandler: (to the one sitting next to him) Really?
Chandler: I don't think so!
Chandler: Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
Chandler: Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
Chandler: And...?
Chandler: I'm not playing with you.
Chandler: She gets crazy! This scar (points to his forehead) is from Pictionary!
Chandler: (nearly whispering) Oh dear God, there's two of them!
Chandler: (to Phoebe) Did you know this about him?
Chandler: (interrupting her) OK!
Chandler: Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
Chandler: (to Phoebe) Do you really find this attractive on him?
Chandler: I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Chandler: Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
Chandler: Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Chandler: (exhausted) Ok, look! Enough is enough!
Chandler: Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
Chandler: But...
Chandler: What about the obsessive cleaning?
Chandler: You ok?
Chandler: No, you didn't.
Chandler: Because I'm gonna play for ya.
Chandler: (In a loving voice) Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
Chandler: (Still in a loving voice) You're welcome, sweetheart.
Chandler: All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
Chandler: And that's... how... it's done!
Chandler: I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
Chandler: I don't know.
Chandler: That's why!
Chandler: So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?
Chandler: Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
Chandler: What must it be like not to be crippled by fear  and self-loathing.
Chandler: How can you be so confident?
Chandler: Really? Like you have a routine?
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh  in a funny and awkard way)
Chandler: Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They  look at each other, both embarassed)
Chandler: ...and beer!!
Ross and Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop  staring at your sister's legs!
Chandler: She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
Chandler: (To Monica) Why...why?
Chandler: Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can  really show it off.
Chandler: Hey Pheebs!
Chandler: Who's Amanda?
Chandler: Are you trying to do a British accent?
Chandler: Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
Chandler: No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
Chandler: Hello? Is someone on the line?
Chandler: Hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the  living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya.
Chandler: (to Amanda) I get pedicures!
Chandler: Hold on! There is something different.
Chandler: Was that place... The Sun?
Chandler: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory  all by yourself!
Chandler: How was your date with Joey?
Chandler: You didn't like that?
Chandler: (without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't  know! (Monica just smiles)
Chandler: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
Chandler: Well, aren't you a treat.
Chandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she  sure can dance... Hey!
Chandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide  from you guys...
Chandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt  like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
Chandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the  good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the  joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
Chandler: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
Chandler: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same  thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
Chandler: No, I just had to get a picture of this.
Chandler: I see you later!
Ross, Rachel and Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
Chandler: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday   was!
Chandler: There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Chandler: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this   party...
Chandler: Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Chandler: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party   she knows is happening.
Chandler: I know, what are we gonna do?
Chandler: I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Chandler: To be fair this one does have nuts.
Chandler: Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
Chandler: We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together   and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed   and switches the camcorder off)
Chandler: Was that Emma? Is she up? 
Chandler: I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday! 
Chandler: To the bathroom!
Chandler: (Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and   Joey come out looking shocked)
Chandler: You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Chandler: I'm begging you stop.
Chandler: (Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going   to do in Vermont! 
Chandler: Thats a bear.
Chandler: Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
Chandler: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
Chandler: They left.
Chandler: I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Chandler: Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old,   that's little.
Chandler: Ooh! That's my girl!
Chandler: Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Chandler: Me too...
Chandler: There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Chandler: I was kidding.
Chandler: No, not yet.
Chandler: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
Chandler: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index   finger again)
Chandler: Let's do it, come on!
Chandler: Thanks!
Chandler: Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Chandler: So excited about your letter!
Chandler: So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Chandler: That's where people make number two!!
Chandler: (reading) I don’t... uh... understand.
Chandler: On every word?
Chandler: And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens   with full sized aortic pumps...?
Chandler: You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us lastyear.
Chandler: Word!
Chandler: She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself  mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a  guy..?
Chandler: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Chandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think? 
Chandler: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Chandler: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
Chandler: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just   call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
Chandler: (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped   off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh...   okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).
Chandler: (Still looks confused) They loved it.
Chandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a  child write the recommendation letter.
Chandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
Chandler: That sounds like fun.
Chandler: I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily)   ... but I am wrong!
Ross: Hey guys. Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.
Chandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was   in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Chandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Chandler: Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my   black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin.   With Janice's phone number on it.
Chandler: (he enters) Hey honey!
Chandler: Is Monica not here?
Chandler: Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for  a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
Chandler: Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas   were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were  mine!!!
Chandler: Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're   right for the part.
Chandler: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think   you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
Chandler: Software that facilitates inter-business networking   e-solutions?
Chandler: Hey you guys. 
Chandler: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for   the part.
Chandler: Joe...
Chandler: Fine!
Chandler: Work, Joe!
Chandler: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest   him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should   learn on their own!
Chandler: That's good! I liked it, they didn't.   (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake,   go to work! (Joey runs away).
Chandler: Hey Joe!
Chandler: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along   to my bosses and they weren't interested.
Chandler: (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.
Chandler: (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey   continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.   Stupid sons of bitches!
Chandler: (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!
Chandler: I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
Chandler: I watched it!
Chandler: (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!
Chandler: (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape.   (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)
Chandler:(In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone)   No!
Chandler: I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
Chandler: What did I just say?
Chandler: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am   insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
Chandler: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Chandler: He really is a chameleon.
Chandler: Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And   I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part   or not.
Chandler: I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you   to forgive me?
Chandler: Lying is wrong!
Chandler: I'm a pretty little girl.
Chandler: That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Chandler: Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the   numbers.
Chandler: It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting   solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Chandler: (to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning   the apartment.
Chandler: You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Chandler: Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Chandler: (pointing at himself) Little people?
Chandler: What...? NO!
Chandler: (he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended   by the insinuation!
Chandler: I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not   mine.
Chandler: Ok, ok, here we go.
Chandler: Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door   and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
Chandler: But you already gave all your money to charity!
Chandler: I don’t think you can do that!
Chandler: That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
Chandler: Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually   to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...   as allowed by law.
Chandler: But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Of course it was!
Chandler: RAT BASTARD!
Monica and Chandler: OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no,   no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No!
Chandler: Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great   with   kids though.
Chandler: (Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Chandler: Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey   bangs on   the door again)
Chandler: WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!! 
Chandler: Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Chandler: (nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!
Chandler: What the hell are you doing?
Chandler: Well, we're not.
Chandler: We don't have a code word.
Chandler: Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
Chandler: (escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept   with   our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so   she can't   see you.
Chandler: Ok!
Chandler: What?
Chandler: And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And   we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)
Chandler: I can explain... Joey...
Chandler: Oh, that's really ok.
Chandler: Wrong number?
Chandler: That's great!
Chandler: Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Chandler: That is the exact same thing.
Chandler:  Hi!
Chandler: We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
Chandler: And so incorrect!
Chandler: Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Chandler: Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
Chandler: I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
Chandler: So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Chandler: Yes, but...
Chandler: Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
Chandler: Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
Chandler: You're gonna be great.
Chandler: Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Chandler: Ok.
Chandler: That's what our friends call us.
Chandler: (astonished) I don't think that's exactly...
Chandler: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?
Chandler: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Chandler: Yeah, wow.
Chandler: No-ot for me it doesn’t.
Chandler: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
Chandler: You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
Chandler: Yeah, I did.
Chandler: We are NOT signing those papers.
Chandler: It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Chandler: You have gotta stop!
Chandler: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Chandler: Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
Chandler: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Chandler: I know..
Chandler: oh, honey..
Chandler: Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. Monica: (realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug)
Chandler: So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
Chandler: You're Jewish.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
Chandler: I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Chandler: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Chandler: Erica wait!
Chandler: You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Chandler: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
Chandler: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
Chandler: You still want that baby?
Chandler: How did the job stuff go?
Chandler: Or facing a bitch of a commute.
Chandler: My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica   looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
Chandler: Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
Chandler: I see.
Chandler: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Chandler: We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse   us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
Chandler: What do you think Pheebs?
Chandler: Yeah.
Chandler: You're kidding!
Chandler: Oh yeah? 
Chandler: I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the   Atlantic.
Chandler: Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
Chandler: It feels like we’re cheating on our house.   And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house,   that does stuff that our house won’t do?
Chandler: And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Chandler: (at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted)
Chandler: (To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?
Chandler: This can not be happening!
Chandler: The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple   are the Hitlers.
Chandler: That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful,   but when did you start crapping money!?
Chandler: Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on   our house. We can still get out.
Chandler: Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder   out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) "Oh My God"! 
Chandler: (looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we   have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly   outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)
Chandler: The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Chandler: Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to   be here.
Chandler: Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Chandler: I never stopped loving you.
Chandler: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice   Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Chandler: Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and   Monica never have to know a thing.
Chandler: (stunned) Obviously.
Chandler: Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Chandler: I understand.
Chandler: (speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.
