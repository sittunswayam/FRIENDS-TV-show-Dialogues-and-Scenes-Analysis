Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?
Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go throughwhat I went through with Carl- oh!
Phoebe: No.
Phoebe: Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the airjust in front of Ross.)
Phoebe: Fine!  Be murky!
Phoebe:  If I let go ofmy hair, my head will fall off. 
Phoebe: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits andkittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- somethingwith mittens... La la la la...something and noodles withstring.  These are a few...
Phoebe: (grins and walks to the kitchen and says toChandler and Joey.) I helped!
Phoebe: What does that mean?  Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)
Phoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. Thatcan't be good.
Phoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Phoebe: (singing) Love is sweet assummer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...islike a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her somechange and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!
Phoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don'twant to put that out into the universe.
Phoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.) 
Phoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. 
Phoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I wasfourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I gothere, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I foundaromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. 
Phoebe: (sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here... 
Phoebe: (sings) What I said you had... 
Phoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?
Phoebe: Oh, yeah! 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've alreadyfluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Phoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you'relike all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way. 
Phoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful. 
Phoebe: No, look, don't touch that! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Phoebe: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Phoebe: She's a waitress. 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, itkinda looks like an old potato. 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Phoebe: (entering) Hi guys! 
Phoebe: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do thisagain!' 
Phoebe: Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha,I already am'. 
Phoebe: Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. 
Phoebe: It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open uptheir monthly, you know, STATEMENT- 
Phoebe: - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
Phoebe: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. 
Phoebe: It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be likestealing. 
Phoebe: Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you knowwhat I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I washappy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine,not-not-mine'... 
Phoebe: Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like thisgiant karmic debt. 
Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! 
Phoebe: Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! 
Phoebe: 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We havecredited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, andhope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.'Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! 
Phoebe: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! 
Phoebe: From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crookedsmile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' 
Phoebe: Hey, Lizzie. 
Phoebe: I brought you alphabet soup. 
Phoebe: Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh,I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.) 
Phoebe: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? 
Phoebe: I know. 
Phoebe: No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. 
Phoebe: Oh, that's fine, no. 
Phoebe: No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. 
Phoebe: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? 
Phoebe: Okay. 
Phoebe: No, I'm fine. 
Phoebe: Huh! 
Phoebe: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
Phoebe: Does, um, anyone wanna see? 
Phoebe: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. 
Phoebe: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? 
Phoebe: Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollarsfor the thumb. 
Phoebe: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with theuniverse?! 
Phoebe: Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not. 
Phoebe: There it is! 
Phoebe: You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care aboutsomeone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair) 
Phoebe: Did he mention us? 
Phoebe: (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seventhousand dollars! 
Phoebe: Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...Andbigger boobs! 
Phoebe: (waking and startling them) Oh! What whatwhat! ...Hi. 
Phoebe: I got no sleep last night! 
Phoebe: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, andthey're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having toreassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! 
Phoebe: Thanks. 
Phoebe: I remember the day I got my first pay check.There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. 
Phoebe: I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? 
Phoebe: (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (Theyscream.)
Phoebe: Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! 
Phoebe: You are just like Jack. 
Phoebe: No, Jack and the Beanstalk. 
Phoebe: Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, butthen he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plantoutside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and youlive in the Village.. 
Phoebe: Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. 
Phoebe: Floopy? 
Phoebe: Oh, like that's a word. 
Phoebe: Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don'tlike this question. 
Phoebe: What? 
Phoebe: I don't even have a 'pl'. 
Phoebe: And-and a power tie? 
Phoebe: Big Bird's friend. 
Phoebe: Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (Sheruns up and takes the binoculars.) 
Phoebe: Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. 
Phoebe: Definitely not his mother. 
Phoebe: Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not foryou, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) 
Monica and Phoebe: Shut up! 
Phoebe: Yeah? 
Phoebe: Uh-huh. 
Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don'tfeel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. 
Phoebe: You'd already broken up. 
Phoebe: A couple hours. 
Phoebe: There he is! There he is! 
Phoebe: Right- where we've been looking all night! 
Phoebe: Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many meanthings, and then not even care.
Phoebe: You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Phoebe: No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. 
Phoebe: Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? Idon't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Phoebe: (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Phoebe: (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Phoebe: Are you gonna go over there?
Phoebe: This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Phoebe: Eww, I don't wanna do that.
Phoebe: Ok, have a good break-up.
Phoebe: Yeah, it was really hard.
Phoebe: Ok, you weren't there.
Phoebe: Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do itreally fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Phoebe: Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have youhad?
Phoebe: Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
Phoebe: All right. 
Phoebe: Wait here. Breathe.
Phoebe: It's like a gift.
Phoebe: Oh, I'd like that.
Phoebe: (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'mgonna do this.
Phoebe: Hey, how'd it go?
Phoebe: Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
Phoebe: That oughta do it.
Phoebe: The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it'snot just Freud, it's Freud!
Phoebe: Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women withthese really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
Phoebe: Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Phoebe: (reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is...just a line.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Phoebe: (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Phoebe: Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, alittle, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Phoebe: Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Phoebe: Seriously, what-what's the part?
Phoebe: No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think youjust get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You'vegotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Phoebe: Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when yousuddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lightsgo out) OK, thank you very much.
Phoebe: Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on mygrandma. (to Monica) What's my number? 
Phoebe: Well, I never call me.
Phoebe: (at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Phoebe: Oh... Milwaukee.
Phoebe: Oh, Rachel.
Phoebe: (singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. Butto me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (shewrites the lyrics down)
Phoebe: About what?
Phoebe: What surprise party?
Phoebe: Well, he didn't tell me.
Phoebe: This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Phoebe: Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by thepeacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he wasmoving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Lookslike I was second to last.
Monica, Joey, and Phoebe: (singing) I'm on top of the world,looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've foundever since...
Phoebe: Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Phoebe: (stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things,right?
Phoebe: (trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are yousure?
Phoebe: Wait a minute. What's his name?
Phoebe: (the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Phoebe: Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kittyanywhere.
Phoebe: Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... sincenobody told me... this is Paolo.
Phoebe: (smiling) You betcha!
Phoebe: I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But Iwon't.
Phoebe: You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare ather)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Phoebe: Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...(time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the roomgets completely dark)
Phoebe: Thanks.
Phoebe: Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Phoebe: I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Phoebe: Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
Phoebe: Oh, that sucks!
Phoebe: Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Phoebe: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, everynow and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her handaround her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! AndDebbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golfcourse- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those littleyellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Phoebe: Thanks!
Phoebe: Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back thepencil)
Phoebe: (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
Phoebe: What'd I say?
Phoebe: God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
Phoebe: Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's inspasm...huh.
Phoebe: You missed a belt loop. 
Phoebe: Okay, it's in spasm.

Phoebe: Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Phoebe: Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I canshow you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey,and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Phoebe: No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Phoebe: Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Phoebe: (stirring pot) Ok, all done.
Phoebe: Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and thenadd some peas and onions.
Phoebe: Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know,before she died.
Phoebe: Almost never.
Phoebe: Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Phoebe: Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.

Phoebe: Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)
Phoebe: David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Phoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Phoebe: Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, excepthe-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all thetime. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...

And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't youunderstand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Phoebe: Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then youput your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me andyou'll never forget me.

Phoebe: Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.)And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues: Paolorolls over, Phoebe looks down, then quickly looks up, bites lip, shakes her head)

Phoebe: (Jumping up) Yeah?
Phoebe: Why? Why would you wanna... do that?  Why?
Phoebe: Well, I mean, Im not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um...I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart,so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.

Phoebe: Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: (Smiling blankly) Right, and its me.
Phoebe: Much as you are.
Phoebe: (Philosophically) Oh, thats good.
Phoebe: Good choice.
Phoebe: Ooh, my first birthday present... (delightedly examining the cardigan inher lap) ..oh, this is really...

Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursulathing, its...
Phoebe: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil oranything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I waseight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under thebus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had aboyfriend who was like your best friend?
Phoebe: Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stolehim away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to meany more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that lookedlike either one of us.
Phoebe: I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Phoebe: Yeah. Okay.

Phoebe: (as Ursula) Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.

Phoebe: Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Phoebe: Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you shouldknow that this money is cursed.
Phoebe: Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Phoebe: (holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look,the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker.
Phoebe: (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.
Phoebe: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.'Coincidence?
Phoebe: Yeah. Um... I'm out. (throws in cards)

Phoebe: Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of mymassage clients.
Phoebe: No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this"massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Phoebe: What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Phoebe: I could be a secretary.
Phoebe: I could do that.
Phoebe: Well, maybe 25-26.
Phoebe: There you go.
Phoebe: (plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?
Phoebe: Oh. Uh, I'm on. (picks up the phone)

Phoebe: I thought you knew that.
Phoebe: Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Phoebe: Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you gotpromoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr.Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah. They even do you.

Phoebe: Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Phoebe: No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know,them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Phoebe: Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them.Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Phoebe: I really do, yeah.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek thatinvited the boss.
Phoebe: You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Phoebe: You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. CaringBoss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., Iwanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Phoebe: Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like,the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them...They still say you're a great boss.

Phoebe: Petrie.
Phoebe: Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Phoebe: I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might getmusical.
Phoebe: (singing) 
Phoebe: Thanks, Ross.
Phoebe: Ok.
Phoebe: Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Phoebe: Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Phoebe: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, youguys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very buildingand your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So juststop all the yelling, just stop it!
Phoebe: Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Phoebe: Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
Phoebe: (singing) They found their bodies the very next day, they found theirbodies the very next...(sees Ross and Susan staring at her) la la la la la la.
Phoebe: This is so great.
Phoebe: I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and mymother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents tomake one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who careabout it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's noteven born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'msorry, you were fighting.
Phoebe: (reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital workerBen. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Phoebe: Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is infact a dark vent.
Phoebe: (from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!
Phoebe: Susan, he looks just like you.
Phoebe: Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he'sopening his eyes. (picture comes back) 
Phoebe: Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Phoebe: Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Phoebe: Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
Phoebe: We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...(hands meat to Monica)
Monica and Phoebe: Ewww!
Phoebe: So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your(provocatively) special someone?
Phoebe: Hey.
Phoebe: How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Phoebe: Jeez, you say one thing, and...
Phoebe: Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)
Phoebe: Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picturedown, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Phoebe: Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Phoebe: So you do know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry.
Phoebe: Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
Phoebe: Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Phoebe: Remembered what?
Phoebe: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Phoebe: I know. This is really, really huge.
Phoebe: Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same everagain.
Phoebe: Here, look, alright, does this help?
Monica and Phoebe: Sure.
Phoebe: Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenthdate.
Phoebe: No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you'realready in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Phoebe: Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Phoebe: Maybe there's someone else.
Phoebe: Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love withRachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind ofgot in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget abouther" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was inlove with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meethim when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the planewith another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enoughabout us. So, how've you been?
Phoebe: Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, allright, what's bigger than huge?
Phoebe: Yes.
Phoebe: 'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't lookgood. I love that voice.
Phoebe: Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering ifthey've changed it?
Phoebe: All right, so what were you thinking?
Phoebe: Ohh! No.
Phoebe: Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable controlfreak.
Phoebe: I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Phoebe: I'm still on "no."
Phoebe: What's goin' on?
Phoebe: Ewww! (Gets up and walks away.)
Phoebe: Where?
Phoebe: (to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Phoebe: All right. Ok, but, but!  You have to promise that you will not beall like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Phoebe: All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna getcut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
Phoebe: All right, that's it, I quit.
Phoebe: Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person whotrusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know,doesn't trust a person.
Phoebe: Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Phoebe: Demi Moore.
Phoebe: Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
Phoebe: Oh.  Oh!
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Phoebe: Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
Phoebe: It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Phoebe: I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip onone side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Phoebe: Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don'tyou come on in. 
Phoebe: (to Chandler and Ross) Thank you.
Phoebe: Oh yeah!  Oh, I can do that.
Phoebe: You wanna do it right now?
Phoebe: (to Rachel) Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell'sthe girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
Phoebe: Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my God,oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Phoebe: I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Phoebe: Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Phoebe: Woof, woof. 
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Oh, all right. What did I have?
Phoebe: Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Phoebe: I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Phoebe: Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
Phoebe: Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we boughtsome, (sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs.
Phoebe: (Monica is yanking on her bra strap) Bras! We bought bras! We boughtbras. 
Phoebe: Ben, dinner!
Phoebe: Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on herwrist and tastes it.)
Phoebe: I licked my arm, what?
Phoebe: So?
Phoebe: You won't even taste it?
Phoebe: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Phoebe: Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
Phoebe: Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Phoebe: You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do withme, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes andsits down.)
Phoebe: Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)
Phoebe: See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who'sThe Boss.
Phoebe: (singing) Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
Phoebe: Hi Monica!
Phoebe: Oh my God, has she slept at all?
Phoebe: Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all Icould hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or aopossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make thephone call.
Phoebe: Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in yourcereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it downthe drain.)
Phoebe: Maybe, because you told him not to.
Phoebe: Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age lovedthat.
Phoebe: Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know shestopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
Phoebe: No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Phoebe: Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair looklike the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.(Ross stands up horrified) There he is.
Phoebe: ( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to theplinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell meyour happy place.
Phoebe: All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. Andget out!
Phoebe: Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have toask that you don't move anything.
Phoebe: Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
Phoebe: All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, thewarm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Phoebe: All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, notpermitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, andthe, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Phoebe: Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Phoebe: (entering) Hello.
Phoebe: Thank you! I know, though.
Phoebe: Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
Phoebe: All right all ready.
Phoebe: We could not, would not want to wait.
Phoebe: I don't know, you might be the first one.
Phoebe: (on machine) "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'malready there when your playing this message?" (to the guys) Is that too spooky?
Phoebe: Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Phoebe: What am I gonna do?
Phoebe: Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
Phoebe: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
Phoebe: Hummus. I got the hummus.
Phoebe: That won't go with this dress though.
Phoebe: Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such abreezy place.
Phoebe: Monica, you don't know that.
Phoebe: Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! (she's wearing anotherdress on a hanger around her neck)
Phoebe: Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
Phoebe: (entering from Rachel's room, wearing a huge bow to cover the stain) Okay,I'm ready.
Phoebe: Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmasribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
Phoebe: Duh!! Christmas!
Phoebe: Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the littlestrappys?
Phoebe: Definitely.

Phoebe: Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No,Monica, no!
Phoebe: How did you do that?
Phoebe: Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Phoebe: (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why haveyou been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward. 
Phoebe: Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Phoebe: Oh, you're not a dingus.
Phoebe: Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this isjust what, what she does to guys, okay.
Phoebe: Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was inJunior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there wasthis guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. Hesaid okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Phoebe: Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really niceguy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Phoebe: Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Phoebe: Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don'thave to walk behind me any more.
Phoebe: (entering) Hi!
Phoebe: Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to himtoday.
Phoebe: Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway hisname is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I wasUrsula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Causeof the restraining order.
Phoebe: Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, thisvery passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, youknow. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Phoebe: No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like youknow, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.

Phoebe: Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Justwalkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did youknow she takes this train?

Phoebe: Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Yeah, I cant say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!
Phoebe: Ugh! I dont know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean ifyou buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler.
Phoebe: (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know inEngland this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, andshe makes the that went right over your head motion) Woo!

Phoebe: Yeah, so please, please, please, dont say anything to Chandler.
Phoebe: Is that a problem?
Phoebe: Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer lets see what you got. All right ya,put em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)
Phoebe: Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the youngmen werent acting Christian enough.
Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh!
Phoebe: Wow! And Im a vegetarian! All right, all right, well Imsorry, well put some ice on it. 
Phoebe: Kay, put your head back.
Phoebe: All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Phoebe: Oh, its the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
Phoebe: Im, Im freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with somethingand she shouldnt have! All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have toask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Phoebe: I am soo dead. (goes to Monicas room)
Phoebe: Isnt it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
Phoebe: I know, you mustve won like a contest or something! 
Phoebe: Im sorry, okay, I-I wasnt looking, and the store says thatthey wont take it back because you signed for it...
Phoebe: When I was you! Y'know what, its all Joeys fault,cause he left his nose open!
Phoebe: Its Monicas bed. What?
Phoebe: So. This has always been Monicas bed, what youre justnoticing now, how self-involved are you?
Phoebe: Well, if you really, really want it, then its okay.
Phoebe: No, no, its just my tooth.
Phoebe: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.
Phoebe: Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob.
Phoebe: Yes, while I was in the chair! Thats why I take such good care ofmy teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Phoebe: Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead.
Phoebe: (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)
Phoebe: All right, fine, fine, but if youre my next victim, dontcome back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
Phoebe: Although, dont feel like you cant visit.
Phoebe: Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe Illkill him.
Phoebe: Well, Im going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on thelook out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you,or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you allthat um...... (starts to cry and runs out)
Phoebe: (running through the door) No! Oh! Youre alive! Youre alive!
Phoebe: Yeah, well, well see about that. Can I use your phone? I justwanna call everyone I know.
Phoebe: (on phone) Hey! Youre not dead! Okay, see ya!
Phoebe: (rushing in) Okay. If youre alive you answer your phone!
Phoebe: Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone isalive.
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is gettingstronger too, to bring down something that big.
Phoebe: Im telling you hes dead. What we are about to have here is adead fat guy on a stick.

Chandler and Phoebe: ...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high pitched,Chandler goes low pitched) love. (they both look at each other.) My endlesslove. (once again they dont match tones, and they just look at each other)
Phoebe: Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watchingfootball, you could help.
Phoebe: Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of thesethings. (just as she sits down).
Phoebe: Oh, can I play too? Ive never played football, like ever. 
Phoebe: Yay!!
Phoebe: Okay, so how do we decide that?
Phoebe: Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
Phoebe: Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
Phoebe: Yeah.

Phoebe: All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know howare we gonna beat three boys?
Phoebe: Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
Phoebe: Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
Phoebe: Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobodytagged Rachel, then isnt the play still going.
Phoebe: Isnt there a national football league.
Phoebe: Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Phoebe: Have fun. Oh wait, no, dont! I forgot I am totally against thatnow.
Phoebe: No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, andtheir, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey,how do you sleep at night?
Phoebe: Really?
Phoebe: (walking up to Joey) Hey.
Phoebe: Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh,all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...
Phoebe: Destiny.
Phoebe: Yes.
Phoebe: Okay. (One of Joeys co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes!That one doesnt look very fulfilled.
Phoebe: You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Phoebe: So, what happens to the old guys?
Phoebe: Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds? (Joeypoints out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to playin the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face againstJoeys shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)
Phoebe: (running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, youdont want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost deadtree she has)
Phoebe: Okay but thats why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil itsChristmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Phoebe: Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this ones yours!Ahhh.
Phoebe: All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one!Im sorry, Im sorry, I didnt mean to get so emotional, I guess itsjust the holidays, its hard.
Phoebe: Oh, I wasnt even thinking about that.

Phoebe: Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles. 
Phoebe: Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it. 
Phoebe: A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. Why don't you get amagician?! 
Phoebe: Well, can you dance at all? 
Phoebe: (covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that? 
Phoebe: Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita? 
Phoebe: Oh yeah.

Phoebe: What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'Myvessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! 
Phoebe: Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. 
Phoebe: (entering) Hey! 
Phoebe: What are you wrapping? 
Phoebe: Yeah, it's a vase. 
Phoebe: Well not exactly like the one in the poem. 
Phoebe: Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)

Phoebe: Thats all right, thats well, I figured.... (they start toleave as Joey enters.)
Phoebe: Listen, Roberts gonna be here any second so, will one of you justtell him?
Phoebe: Please, right now, no, every time I see him its like Is iton the lose? Is it watching me?
Phoebe: Hey.
Phoebe: No, I can spot you from here.
Phoebe: Okay, listen Robert...
Phoebe: Umm, I think youre really, really great...
Phoebe: I-I-I-I-I dont know, I dont know what to say.
Phoebe: Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of thatbefore.
Phoebe: (to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both atthe same time?
Phoebe: Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done.
Phoebe: Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs.
Phoebe: Hey Leslie, howd you know Id be here?
Phoebe: Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Phoebe: Hmm, bummer.
Phoebe: No. But thanks.
Phoebe: Okay. No. But thanks.
Phoebe: Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, onceyou betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow. Very cold, hard, unyielding,y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have atissue, please?
Phoebe: Wheres Chandler?
Phoebe: Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in theoven)
Phoebe: Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together.Thats the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Phoebe: Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, ourMoms worked on the barge together.
Phoebe: You never run on a barge!
Phoebe: Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Phoebe: Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasntcalled. Not that I even care, y'know.
Phoebe: You think you know me so well.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Thats what I said.
Phoebe: I cant. I cant. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted herand then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone. Y'know what the saddest partis, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in likeall my lives.
Phoebe: (singing) I stepped in something icky.
Phoebe: (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat,smelly cat, its not your fault.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah!
Phoebe: I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
Phoebe: Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire bynow, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Phoebe: Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thatsreally, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upsidedown to play it.)
Phoebe: (to Leslie) Oh, I thought you werent coming. What? Where were you?
Phoebe: Okay, dont give me a reason to get mad, okay
Phoebe: No, look, I told you that I didnt want you to try and sell it, andyou just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probablywouldve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if Icant trust you then just forget it.

Phoebe: Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Phoebe: Theyve been quiet for a long time.

Phoebe: Oh good! Okay. Cause you were acting like you didnt.
Phoebe: No, I know, I know, that this is Franks life, (walks behind them,they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I dont want tobe all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, its sick and wrong!
Phoebe: No-no, oh, Im fine with the age thing y'know, until it startssticking its tongue down my little brothers throat! 
Phoebe: But, I mean, do you think hes gonna enjoy it when hes up tohis elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?!

Phoebe: Yeah, I know. Its a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
Phoebe: Y'know what, forget it. Its ruined. 
Phoebe: Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.

Phoebe: Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Phoebe: What umm, what happened?

Phoebe: Uh, well I can tell you why. Its, its because of me. But,y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
Phoebe: Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of madeher see why you two shouldnt be together, y'know. And youre gonna see it to,one day, you really, really will.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Okay, but.
Phoebe: Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totallyevil thing, but I so didnt. Theres someone here who can explain this betterthan I can.
Phoebe: Yeah, but not just that.
Phoebe: None the less.
Phoebe: Thats right, exactly. (sees them) All right, its a good byekiss, thats good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (Theyboth lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is thatyou see what Im saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignoreher) Okay, Ive decided Im gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get mypurse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).
Phoebe: We were out of Doritos.
Monica and Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
Phoebe: What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Phoebe: Huh.
Phoebe: Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, youre not over Ross yet andyou have issues with your father.
Phoebe: Okay, so its probably just the Ross thing then.
Phoebe: So, youre like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)
Phoebe: Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just nameit after yourself.
Phoebe: Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.

Phoebe: Oh, its so great to see you feeling like this!
Phoebe: Wait, am I missing something though? Cause I thought death wassomething thats supposed to be sad, in a way.
Phoebe: Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
Phoebe: No, just a barrel.
Phoebe: Really?! Really?!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! Its so beautiful.
Phoebe: So, Im here, ready to play.
Phoebe: I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (Sheremoves this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to thehouse.)
Phoebe: Thats a dog, every house should have a dog.
Phoebe: Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactivewaste.
Phoebe: No, no, thats the ghost for the attic.
Phoebe: Well, nobody wants a ghost. But youve got one, because the houseis sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Phoebe: Okay, obviously you dont know much about the U.S. government.
Phoebe: (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into thehouse!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.)Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Phoebe: Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, were notwelcome in the house of no imagination.

Phoebe: Oh, okay, its the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slidesa doll down the slide)
Phoebe: The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests comeover, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
Phoebe: Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights someincense)
Phoebe: Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around thehouse.)

Phoebe: Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)
Phoebe: Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Phoebe: Umm, oh, about three months.
Phoebe: Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Phoebe: Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. Theyrequire constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lots and lotsof love.
Phoebe: (to Pete) Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
Phoebe: Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?
Phoebe: Cause youre still into Monica. So you told her there wassomebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if youspent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Phoebe: Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantialgift.

Phoebe: Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing its one of those 801 numbers. Right?
Phoebe: No, no, no, oh no-no-no, its has to be 800. (picks up theinstruction manual to check the phone number) Cause all those big companies have 800numbers, every one. (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Phoebe: Sorry, Im so sorry, I will pay you back.

Phoebe: Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (shedrags him away)
Phoebe: (entering with Rachel) and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just,always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Phoebe: (disgusted) Uh.
Phoebe: Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work.It's like I'm working in the field.
Phoebe: Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He'sso burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)
Phoebe: Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Phoebe: Yeah.

Phoebe: God, that is the nicest kitchen.
Phoebe: No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have agreat day.
Phoebe: All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Phoebe: Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, its just Jasons sosensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive its just better thanhaving just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinkingabout the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
Phoebe: Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Phoebe: Wow! I didnt know you guys actually used those. 
Phoebe: Umm, wow. This-this isnt gonna be easy. Umm, I dont think weshould see each other anymore.
Phoebe: Im sorry.
Phoebe: Oh my God, I didnt
Phoebe: (running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
Phoebe: (to Ross) Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing,you should go to my herbal guy.
Phoebe: (gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They bothlook at her.) Like for clubbing. 
Phoebe: Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Phoebe: No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out hesincredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoaldrawings that he drew of me.
Phoebe: Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy accessto a lot of charcoal.
Phoebe: Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay soJason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now sos Vince (holds up one finger onher other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vinceside) So Its really just about the math.
Phoebe: (knocks on the door) Jason?
Phoebe: Nah-ha!
Phoebe: (singing) Crazy underwear, creepin up my butt. (Jasonenters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear (Inher head) Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keepplaying. Youll get through this; youll be fine. (She tries to continue thesong, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out asgibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to meafter the show.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: I dont know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
Phoebe: Yeah, okay, Ive-Ive been dating both of you, and itsbeen really horrible. Cause y'know its been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-Ilike you both, and I, and I didnt know how to chose, so... Im sorry, Imjust, Im terrible, Im a terrible person. Im terrible.
Phoebe: Really?!
Phoebe: Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)
Phoebe: Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
Phoebe: (to Vince) Well, that couldve been really awkward.
Phoebe: Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, Im gonna do that for you.
Phoebe: All right, so, so you went to Petes...
Phoebe: So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?

Phoebe: Yeesh, whatd you do about it?
Phoebe: Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Phoebe: Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if Iset Ross up on a date?
Phoebe: Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute,and now that you two arent together, she asked if I could set it up, but ifyoure not cool with it...
Phoebe: You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. Shes yeah,like, average height, medium build, bald...
Phoebe: Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)
Phoebe: Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)
Phoebe: (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Phoebe: Yeah, she was bald, shes not now.
Phoebe: I dont know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Phoebe: Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Phoebe: Well, maybe it wont work out. Maybe Ross wont like herpersonality.
Phoebe: Oh no, Bonnies the best!
Phoebe: So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Phoebe: Ohh, thats too bad!
Phoebe: Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Phoebe: Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Phoebe: Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, orinside his shower drain?
Phoebe: No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) Its a lineof ants! Theyre working as a team!
Phoebe: (looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross isbreaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Lets go.
Phoebe: Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Phoebe: You said it was okay!
Phoebe: What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Phoebe: Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I dont get it.Arent you the one that decided that you didnt want to be with Ross?
Phoebe: Well isnt he your friend? Dont you want him to be happy?
Phoebe: So?
Phoebe: (sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.

Phoebe: She was acting, she was pretending like she hasnt heard from himon years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look (shows Monica)! Isnt thiswhat he would look like now?
Phoebe: I dont know, but were having dinner tomorrow night, so Ifigured, shes gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to,buy me presents, I dont know! So, youre all bored?

Phoebe: My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Phoebe: Oh.

Phoebe: I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born,and everyone started lying their asses off!
Phoebe: How close?
Phoebe: I dont even know how that would work!
Phoebe: (interrupting) Im not asking!
Phoebe: Yeah. Lets see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off,and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.

Phoebe: Okay, well umm, I know that we havent talked in a long time, butumm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Phoebe: (shocked) You know her?!

Phoebe: Noooo!!
Phoebe: No. Im-Im to depressed to talk.
Phoebe: (singing) ...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of mybedroommmm. (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count thecolours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you.You go away.

Phoebe: Oh my God, so do I!
Phoebe: Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Phoebe: Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you.
Phoebe: Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry.
Phoebe: All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out.

Phoebe: Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Phoebe: Yeah, I actually dont know...
Phoebe: Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes overand picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cats eyes) Oh my God.
Phoebe: Nothing. Nothing.
Phoebe: I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is myMother.
Phoebe: No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my MomLily, the one who killed herself.
Phoebe: No Dr. Skeptismo! Im sure. First of all, okay, theres thefeeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into myguitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) MyMothers favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but thennods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (tothe cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an Oh my God. gesture) Oh, Ihavent seen this smile in 17 years!
Phoebe: (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming,trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Phoebe: Well, Im not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used tothe fact that theres y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think shes worried thaty'know, shes gonna, shes gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice)Well, thats not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call inthe other room.
Phoebe: Well, Im returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. Ijust spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monicas room)
Phoebe: (entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy andpurred.
Phoebe: I just feel so, uhh.....
Phoebe: Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Phoebe: Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!
Phoebe: Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have torespect her decision. Right?
Phoebe: (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross,how many parents have you lost?
Phoebe: Okay, then you dont know what it feels like when one of them comesback. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if Im wrong, who cares? Just be afriend. Okay? Be supportive.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: I think she would like that.
Phoebe: Thank you. We both forgive you.
Phoebe: Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot tome. And youre welcome to come back anytime.
Phoebe: Come on, Mom, Ill take you home.
Phoebe: Okay, I didnt hear that.
Phoebe: Wow! And hey, its cool if youre a lesbian! (Givesher a thumbs up)
Phoebe: Thats weird.
Phoebe: Your nails.
Phoebe: Oh, no, I meant that its weird that you only have ninenow.
Phoebe: Okay, dont panic. Im gonna go to the store,Im gonna get you another set of nails, no ones gonna know, and youregonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, its causetheyre gonna eatthats the problem.
Phoebe: And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Phoebe: I dont get it.
Phoebe: Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: This used to be your room? (She nods Yes) Wow! Youmustve been in really good shape as a kid.
Phoebe: Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Phoebe: No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change whatit means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hiredto do, and well call that pulling a Monica.
Phoebe: Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight As, his parents wouldsay, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go,"Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcersays, "Yeah, that ones outta here." Though some things dont change.
Phoebe: Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joinsMonica.)
Phoebe: Theyre not even touching the lasagna!
Phoebe: Oh, they love your casserole.
Phoebe: Its hard to believe that just a little while ago thiswas nothing but ingredients.
Phoebe: Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They bothlook at her) (to Monica) She doesnt know we switched it. (Monica nods her headNo.)
Phoebe: Oh. 
Phoebe: Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Phoebe: Hey! New wallet, huh?
Phoebe: Oh please, somebody tell me I dont have to go to work today!
Phoebe: Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and everytime I see him I just want to do things to him that Im not allowed to charge for.
Phoebe: Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for foolingaround with clients. And its against my oath as a masseuse.
Phoebe: No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients andumm, always be prepared. Yeah, that ones actually from the Boy Scouts, but it justmakes good sense.
Phoebe: No, I can handle it. No, Im a professional. (She starts to leave)
Phoebe: I dont what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues toleaqve)
Phoebe: Because its Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Phoebe: These old things.
Phoebe: You mean theOkay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Phoebe: Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles inthe siadic area can get yknow, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm,tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Phoebe: Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)
Phoebe: No!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey.
Phoebe: Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Phoebe: On the touchy.
Phoebe: No, I know! I-Im sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wannathrow out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Phoebe: (thinking to herself) Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay,slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little Oh nowait no, no!No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rickspants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, thats working.
Phoebe: (thinking to herself) Chandlers knees. Chandlersankles. Chandlers ankle hair. (notices the clock) Oh no. (to Rick) Okay, youreall set.
Phoebe: Yeah! In really long hour world.
Phoebe: Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because youre aclient, I cant ask you out, even though you give me yknow, the feeling.
Phoebe: Really?!
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: (laughs) Okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)
Phoebe: Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isnt what it looks like,cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Phoebe: Yes, I will tell her.
Phoebe: Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we startedmaking out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
Phoebe: Its so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
Phoebe: I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next,yknow? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then thesepolicemen, thought I was a whore too. Its been a really bad day, whore wise.
Phoebe: Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
Phoebe: Great! Thank you very much.
Phoebe: Thank you.
Phoebe: (entering) Oh.
Phoebe: (in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is allI really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table,and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)
Phoebe: Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneezein the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People.(Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? (Stopssinging) This chick sounds good. (Singing) Smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing)Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Phoebe: (singing, drunk) My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do youstick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey. 
Phoebe: It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)
Phoebe: Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying tohelp sick hamsters.
Phoebe: Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Phoebe: So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozyvoice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
Phoebe: Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that"Woo-hoo" thing.
Phoebe: Hey.
Phoebe: Hi.
Phoebe: Wow, cute one!
Phoebe: Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears hervoice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries tosing) My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
Phoebe: Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should beeasy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Phoebe: You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouthwhen you do that!
Phoebe: (entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, helooks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Phoebe: (to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. Andthere's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water. 
Phoebe: (picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.
Phoebe: But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Phoebe: It's okay. How's the soup?
Phoebe: (singing) Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street.Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to Gunther) Does it even workwithout my sexy voice?
Phoebe: Gunther, kiss me.
Phoebe: (singing) And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thankyou my babies.
Phoebe: Hey what are you guys looking at? 
Phoebe: Yeah, come to papa. 
Phoebe: Oo! Is it for my birthday present? 
Phoebe: Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it justhasn't come yet? 
Phoebe: 'Kay. 
Phoebe: Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate'sgirlfriend!" 
Phoebe: It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow! 
Phoebe: Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , notMonican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playingaround with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not? 
Phoebe: There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lendyou money, but just get moving! 
Phoebe: Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked inmonths. 
Phoebe: Yes, but I'm doing this. 
Phoebe: Ooo, a crossword! Can I help? 
Phoebe: Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language. 
Phoebe: Mon! I'm so happy for you! 
Phoebe: I'll have one, please. Plus my money. 
Phoebe: Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank. 
Phoebe: Yes. Did you settle the bill? 
Phoebe: Oh, look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker) 
Phoebe: Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took! 
Phoebe: But Mon, you have to get our money! 
Phoebe: I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother'sfuneral was? 
Phoebe: Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are somepeople who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massagewasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know,"these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!" 
Phoebe: Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill. 
Phoebe: She seems fine now. 
Phoebe: You didn't get the money, did you? 
Phoebe: No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinksshe is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow? 
Phoebe: Okay, Widow! 
Phoebe: Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly thisis a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve tobe paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paidevery penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no placeelse to go. 
Phoebe: Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica witheveryone staring at her.) 
Phoebe: Uh... yay! 
Phoebe: Yeah. I'm a hard ass. 
Phoebe: Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime! 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Phoebe: Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties! 
Phoebe: Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Phoebe: (singing) "Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair.Swinging with the greatest of ease" Darn it! Now, I dont know who toget to the next verse.
Phoebe: Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know aboutbah-bah-bha-bhan?
Phoebe: Oh yeah, thats right, the keyboards, huh?
Phoebe: I wanna hear "The Sound."
Phoebe: Come on, play that funky music white boy.
Phoebe: Wow, it was sowow!
Phoebe: What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plusits just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Phoebe: (pushing Monica back onto the couch) Its so inspired! Look at him!Look at him go!
Phoebe: Oh no, Im not playing tonight.
Phoebe: I cant follow Ross! Itd be like those bicycle ridding chimpsthat followed The Beetles. No.
Phoebe: Oh my God, hes not even appreciated in his own time. I would giveanything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Phoebe: You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)
Phoebe: Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Phoebe: Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
Phoebe: Yeah, I-I cantI mean yknow I was trying to be reallyy'know okay and upbeat about it, I justI feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.I
Phoebe: Oh no. No-no-no, dont do that! How could I live with myself if Iknew I was depriving the world of your music.
Phoebe: Does Joey know?
Phoebe: I think maybe, yeah.
Phoebe: Yeah! No, thats right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Phoebe: Oh my God, hes lost it. Hes totally lost it.
Phoebe: After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Phoebe: Look everyone, its the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Phoebe: Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a newbusiness and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and thenwe each only buy one gift. And-and theres the added mystery of who gets who.
Phoebe: I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Phoebe: Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its likeimpossible to get her something she likes. Come on, lets trade!
Phoebe: Ohh.
Phoebe: You dont have to do that, Ross and Joey arent here, you canwatch the parade if you want.
Phoebe: God, what happened?!
Phoebe: Open it up, let me see.
Phoebe: Ooh, God it looks bad.
Phoebe: Honey, youve got to go. Whats his office number?
Phoebe: (on phone) Hi! Yeah, Im calling on behalf of Monica Gellerseye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) Hes out of town,but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Phoebe: Yes! Shes very excited about that.
Phoebe: This is so cool, til Monica gets back, its like Imhead chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, andthen decides to add it to the dish.)
Phoebe: Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Phoebe: All right I I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cookingquestion.
Phoebe: Yeah, I can see where Id be your best shot but, no. Imsorry, but I think its twisted.
Phoebe: Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where youcan actually use the phrase, "Thats not how your dad used to do it."
Phoebe: Oh, Ill get it. (goes over to the door.)
Phoebe: Oh, he-he cant talk right now.
Phoebe: Hes just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
Phoebe: They were threefold.
Phoebe: Oh, she sees him! Oh, theyre hugging!
Phoebe: Oh, there they are!
Phoebe: All right, get a room.
Phoebe: Okay!
Phoebe: Okayyyyy, open up! 
Phoebe: Yeah, its for our catering business!
Phoebe: No, were gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with abaguette. 
Phoebe: And also, we dont know what to do with this. (She turns on aswitch and the girls nipples light up.)
Phoebe: Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Phoebe: How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Phoebe: Oh, in that case(hops up and down in joy)Yay! (Monica looksconfused) That was me hopping on board.
Phoebe: Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Phoebe: Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Phoebe: Oh, okay! (reading) "Would I go back to Allesandros? Sure,but Id have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun tomy head." (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.
Phoebe: Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van forcatering.
Phoebe: No-no, its okay. But are we sure we dont want the waterbed?
Phoebe: Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)
Phoebe: Bye!
Phoebe: (on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
Phoebe: Hey, Monica!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!

Phoebe: Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The weddingreception.
Phoebe: But weve only had one job.
Phoebe: Yeah! What are you saying?
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Youre the cook! With out you its just me driving up topeoples houses with empty trays and asking for money!
Phoebe: For what? I cant believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves) 
Phoebe: Okay, Im hearing.

You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause)Yknow what, I want you to take the chef job.
Phoebe: Yeah. Thats what you really want. Yeah, I dont want to bethe reason youre unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I reallydont want to be the reason Im unhappy.
Phoebe: Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
Phoebe: Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obviousmouth full, nods yes.)
Phoebe: Where were you?
Phoebe: Oh, which museum?
Phoebe: (just Phoebe) No, answer his.
Phoebe: Umm, that papers two weeks old. 
Phoebe: Whats wrong Mon?
Phoebe: Oh.

Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: So! Ross doesnt really decorate his tree withfloss, but you dont hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar whichwakes up Ross with a start.)
Phoebe: So, did you pick one yet?
Phoebe: Well look, you dont really like the one from uptown andyoure too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just endthem both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on yourway back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, youredone!
Phoebe: Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Phoebe: Theres sooo much you dont know.
Phoebe: (singing) "Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap.                               Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap.                               Said all you need is to write them a song.                               They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along.                               No, don't sing along.
Phoebe: Oh my God! I cant believe my little brother is married!
Phoebe: You guys, why didnt you tell me you were eloping?

Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Oh! Ooh! Umm!
Phoebe: Hey, why dont you?
Phoebe: Uh-huh, yeah!

Phoebe: Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decidedIm gonna carry their baby.
Phoebe: No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this isa totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.

Phoebe: Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, causeIm-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Phoebe: Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a lot of pressure on me and myuterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is thereis maybe is there something that Ican do yknow just to like help make sure I get pregnant?

Phoebe: Nope, not knocked up yet.
Phoebe: Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, Im gonna do whatever I can to helpthis so, Im just gonna yknow, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chairand drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, Im let gravityyknow, do its jobs.

Phoebe: Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Phoebe: Wait a minute.

Phoebe: He just got a divorce right? 
Phoebe: So hes probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, youjust have to make the first move.
Phoebe: (shocked) Youve never asked a guy out?!!

Phoebe: Im telling it! Im telling it!
Phoebe: Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also needmassages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give themassages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you knowwhat Ive got?
Phoebe: No! Think about it, its a taxi that people take when they need torelax, its
Phoebe: The name was my favourite part!
Phoebe: YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! Thatsnot good.
Phoebe: Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinksthats better than Relaxi Cab.
Phoebe: Oh, that is better.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: (not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, its justIm so pregnant that Imy guitar doesnt fit anymore. So I thoughttil Im not, Im just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds reallycool!

Phoebe: No, Im-Im not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a namestarting with "The."
Phoebe: Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joeyand Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, Idontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.
Phoebe: God, Susan is so fun!
Phoebe: Yeah, I definitely. I dont like the name Ross.
Phoebe: No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Phoebe: Well, its just yknow that something like this would never tolike The Hulk, yknow
Phoebe: So, I decided Im definitely going to go with either Joey orChandler.
Phoebe: Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if its likeyknow, Chanoey?
Phoebe: All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Phoebe: Umm, Gene.

Phoebe: Boy! I didnt see that coming!

Phoebe: (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.)(Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I dont feel good about it.
Phoebe: Thats so funny to think if youd just done that right afterthe last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Phoebe: Okay, scarfs done. (Its not really a scarf, its just abunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging withthem Joey and Chandler.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
Phoebe: Hey!

Phoebe: Good. Yknowno-no, okay, its-it feels likeeverythings been about me lately, so whats happening with you?
Phoebe: Oh!
Phoebe: Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the streetand this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Phoebe: Well, lets see, its not. Really, like that. Because, you seethat was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like yknow a bunch ofyknow high school crap that nobody really gives yknow
Phoebe: Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)
Phoebe: (sips it) Its so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh ofrelief.) Oh, thanks.
Phoebe: (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)
Phoebe: Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
Phoebe: Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know thatwas definitely one.
Phoebe: No. Its all right; its probably false labour. They saidthat, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Phoebe: Well, do you see any babies?
Phoebe: Okay, I guess. I mean I dont know, its just, I guess Iknow its going to be over soon.

Phoebe: Okay, I have a wedgie.
Phoebe: So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Phoebe: Yeah, I do. Whats the matter?
Phoebe: Eh, dont be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in lovewith was getting married
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
Phoebe: We thought you knew!
Phoebe: Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Phoebe: Oh no, Ross doesnt know anything.
Phoebe: Well, because we thought you knew!! Its so obvious! God, thatwould be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean."
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Phoebe: Well, I think I can help you get over him.
Phoebe: Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Phoebe: And a small piece of chocolate.
Phoebe: And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)
Phoebe: Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you,the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didnt feel like getting up. Okay,Im gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And youre going to remember all ofthe bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Phoebe: Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that Ilove Ross, I think hes such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabsit out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that youre with Rossokay and imagine that youre kissing him. And youre-youre running yourhands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh grossits some kind of grease, itsuck! Hah?
Phoebe: Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, lets trysome uh, aversion therapy.
Phoebe: Okay?
Phoebe: So uh, now look at the picture

Phoebe: What?! What do you mean youre going to London?
Phoebe: IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!
Phoebe: Thats not why youre going! Youre going because youhope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that Britishchippy."
Phoebe: No! Because hes in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, ifyou go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Yknow,its too late! You missed youre chance! Im sorry, I know this must bereally hard, its over.

Phoebe: No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I everget to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Phoebe: Well, it felt French.
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Yeah?

Phoebe: All rightOoh! Oh dead God, save me! 
Phoebe: I'm having my first contraction!
Phoebe: Ooh, it's not bad.
Phoebe: Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!

Phoebe: Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt eitherOoh,yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! (Checks under the blanket.) Oh, I was kinda hoping thatwas it.
Phoebe: Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now Ithink he's just trying to steal my thunder.
Phoebe: Hey.
Phoebe: It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'my'know, dilatedamundo!
Phoebe: (interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Justget me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Phoebe: Hi! And you're going into what grade?

Phoebe: Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be havingbabies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Phoebe: They are. Why?
Phoebe: Happy birthday!
Phoebe: I know, it is.
Phoebe: Can I tell you a little secret?
Phoebe: I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)
Phoebe: Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Phoebe: Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they'rey'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss anopportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Phoebe: Oh, just ask him!
Phoebe: I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate thatwould be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
Phoebe: You're right. 
Phoebe: Tell him it's for you.
Phoebe: (To Rachel) So did you ask him?
Phoebe: Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Phoebe: Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Phoebe: Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me todo.
Phoebe: Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
Phoebe: What is that?
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Phoebe: I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Phoebe: Which one do you have?
Phoebe: But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know
Phoebe: Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a secondalone with the babies.
Phoebe: So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in thatlittle petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but theywere wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home andsee you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sisterhas a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Littlehigh fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.)Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)
Phoebe: I know.
Phoebe: Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Phoebe: They're gonna call her Chandler.
Phoebe: Works on you.
Phoebe: Ugh, PBS!
Phoebe: Ugh, what's right with them?
Phoebe: Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in thisreally bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if Iwrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No oneever wrote back.
Phoebe: All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.I didn't have keys!
Phoebe: This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totallyselfish.
Phoebe: What-what are you talking about?!
Phoebe: Yeah. So?
Phoebe: Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Phoebe: Yeah, it's Y'know there'sno you may not!
Phoebe: Are you calling me selfish?!
Phoebe: I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evilgenius.
Phoebe: Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
Phoebe: Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)
Phoebe: I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guythat lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on hisfront stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful.That old jackass!
Phoebe: I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to threechildren and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Phoebe: Ooh-ohh!
Phoebe: Why?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cuther out of your life.
Phoebe: (on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you knowthat I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
Phoebe: Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The beeis happy and I am definitely not.
Phoebe: (Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)
Phoebe: Ooh, it's not a toy.
Phoebe: (on phone) Hi Joey.
Phoebe: I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Phoebe: Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness tolots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a goodthing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
Phoebe: No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Phoebe: Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Phoebe: Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV!Oh that makes me feelOh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and thereforeit's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)
Phoebe: Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Phoebe: Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna seeRachel anymore?
Phoebe: Yeah that's better than my way.
Phoebe: (To Chandler) Can you hear anything?
Phoebe: Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)
Phoebe: I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
Chandler and Phoebe: Yeah, me either.
Phoebe: Hey.
Phoebe: Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Phoebe: Ehh!!
Phoebe: Come where?
Phoebe: Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Phoebe: Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind hisback.) Forever.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Phoebe: We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying totake Joey!
Phoebe: The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And ifyou win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Phoebe: Count for what?
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to mygrandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I haveheirlooms for crying out loud.
Phoebe: Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's afur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)
Phoebe: Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me butat all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Phoebe: Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband saidsomeone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Phoebe: Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Phoebe: I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
Phoebe: That might work! (She gives him the coat.)
Phoebe: Why?
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium? 
Phoebe: He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know,bring in the next person I know who dies.
Phoebe: This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, deathis fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Here'sPhoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal trapsof wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in themirror.) 'Cause I do.
Phoebe: Nooo!!
Phoebe: I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Phoebe: Oh, I know.
Phoebe: All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts onher fur coat.)
Phoebe: Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not verynice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever hadwrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says toMonica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Phoebe: Are you still mad at us?
Phoebe: Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Phoebe: (To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to playbut is stopped by)
Phoebe: Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Phoebe: Yes! Exactly! And that's why
Phoebe: Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing aseeing-eye dog coat!
Phoebe: Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Phoebe: Hi Emily!
Phoebe: Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)
Phoebe: (to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they'remean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to becoats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here.(She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!
Phoebe: Umm, do health inspectors work on commission? 
Phoebe: It's okay to laugh right?
Phoebe: Okay. (She laughs harder.)
Phoebe: Yum-my!
Phoebe: Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Phoebe: Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You sawthe hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Phoebe: Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Phoebe: Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean placesto eat.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: He's so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)
Phoebe: (smiles) Show me the badge again.
Phoebe: Shiny. 
Phoebe: (laughing) You are just nonstop!
Phoebe: Why?!
Phoebe: (awed) You have the power to do that?
Phoebe: (excited) Shut it down.
Phoebe: Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut itdown!
Phoebe: Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See youladle." (Laughs.)
Phoebe: Ooh, absolutely!
Phoebe: Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.
Phoebe: Enh. Sure!
Phoebe: Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! Thatthis milk is mine. Ibought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but hasto turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!
Phoebe: Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry thehealth inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like,okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Phoebe: Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go!(He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, Iknow a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Phoebe: Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Phoebe: Monica your remote doesn't work.
Phoebe: Oh. Aw, forget it.
Phoebe: Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Phoebe: I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Phoebe: Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine'sworse!
Past Life Phoebe: More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some morebandages in here! This man is dying(She is cut off by an exploding shell justoutside the tent. When the smoke clears, she's missing an arm and the blood is pumping outlike you'd see in a horror movie. And upon seeing her condition, she says) Oh no.
Phoebe: Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Phoebe: Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Phoebe: Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuckon his head!
Phoebe: (surprised) Hello?
Phoebe: Joey? What's going on?
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Phoebe: (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Phoebe: Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Phoebe: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a deadanimal.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
Phoebe: All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Phoebe: Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't evenknow that happened. So which one was it?
Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
Phoebe: Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
Phoebe: Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'knowwhatever.
French Phoebe:  Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I pleaseget some gauze in here! (A shell explodes outside next to the tent and when the smokeclears, Phoebe still has her arm.) Whew! (Her arm falls off and starts pumping out blood.)This is getting ridiculous uh! 
Phoebe: What am I sitting on?
Phoebe: (taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies! 
Phoebe: Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the NewSchool and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
Phoebe: Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and thistime I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a lesspainful final exam.
Phoebe: Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone tosit with!
Phoebe: Yeah! Okayooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Phoebe: This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Phoebe: Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. Ilearned that living on the street.
Phoebe: Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note andthe gang reads it.)
Phoebe: Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Phoebe: Well, he stabbed me first!!
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: I thought you said you read it in high school.
Phoebe: Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff andumm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I thinkrepresents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
Phoebe: (To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!
Phoebe: Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Phoebe: I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
Phoebe: Would you care to venture one?
Phoebe: Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Phoebe: Okay then.
Phoebe: Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: You didn't read this one either?!
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: No! You should've read it yourself!
Phoebe: Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's awoman, but she's not. She's a cyborg. 
Phoebe: Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Phoebe: Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some veryinteresting insights.
Phoebe: (smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing JaneEyre to Robocop. 
Phoebe: Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Phoebe: Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know,people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to highschool.
Phoebe: All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's giveour friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Phoebe: What's going on?
Phoebe: So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Phoebe: I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you gotcut off.
Phoebe: I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Phoebe: Hey you guys, guess what?
Phoebe: Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.)Since its Christmastime. Im going to be one of those people collectiondonations.
Phoebe: (Excitedly) Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get mybucket.
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah, Im going to be out there spreading joy to thepeople. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year,Im going to do the whole city.
Phoebe: Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, theyhardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but Im the only one who can sing"Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.
Phoebe: Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man putsome change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. (She waves her hand up anddown as if she is spreading joy.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Well, it's going okay.
Phoebe: Oh, thanks!
Phoebe: Wow!
Phoebe: Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Phoebe: Just get your nails done?
Phoebe: Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm andspreads her joy.)
Phoebe: Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
Phoebe: Wait, you can't take the money out.
Phoebe: But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
Phoebe: Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still
Phoebe: Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just (Shescowls at him.)
Phoebe: Thank you, Happy Holidays.
Phoebe: Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't (The lady ignores her andwalks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Phoebe: Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yetanother guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that.(She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What isthat?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!
Phoebe: Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people putin here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Phoebe: Does it look like an ashtray?
Phoebe: Does it look like a urinal?
Phoebe: Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. NiceBucket!
Phoebe: Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'knowwhat? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with youguys. Sorry. (Leaves.)
Phoebe: Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.(The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws thelint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)
Phoebe: Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there andthen you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on hisface.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-workerwalk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thoughtI told you to get outta here!
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: That chick can't handle my corner.
Phoebe: Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.)(The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out forthat bitch. (The old lady.)
Phoebe: It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Phoebe: You too!
Phoebe: Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Phoebe: Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially theones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Phoebe: Really?! How come?
Phoebe: Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Phoebe: Well, I taught me and I love me.
Phoebe: Hey! 
Phoebe: Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you.
Phoebe: Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch theguitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to theguitar.)
Phoebe: Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of thechords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (Shestarts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note: For this one you'll have to use yourimagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to seethem, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her handand then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm,Turkey Leg and Old Lady. (Joey tries to imitate them.)
Phoebe: Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Phoebe: Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)
Phoebe: Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there?Did you?!
Phoebe: Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings.Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want tolearn to play guitar?
Phoebe: Then don't touch one!!
Phoebe: Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact hedoes it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph, did you even study at alllast night?
Phoebe: Then do Iceberg!
Phoebe: G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords?(Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God! 
Phoebe: No, but you're questioning my method!
Phoebe: Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Phoebe: Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Phoebe: Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come cryingto me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
Phoebe: Oh, fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)
Phoebe: No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Phoebe: Uh-huh!
Phoebe: No!
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hangaround there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Phoebe: Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)
Phoebe: Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So
Phoebe: That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you andEmily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about theLouisiana Purchase?
Phoebe: Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Phoebe: Okay, then what happened?
Phoebe: (gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!
Phoebe: Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) Thisis not over!
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: What were you doing?
Phoebe: Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)
Phoebe: You two will have very hairy children.
Phoebe: So are you actually gonna see her again?
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Phoebe: Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Phoebe: Ohhh.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Are you serious?!
Phoebe: You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We
Phoebe: (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just anold Wonton!
Phoebe: Ohh, tough call.
Phoebe: Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from thehospital.
Phoebe: Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Phoebe: It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not likeI'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Phoebe: Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to thecoffeehouse!
Phoebe: It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's likey'know, one life ends and another begins.
Phoebe: Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get someyogurt and she just never came back up again.
Phoebe: It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear,you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkoutcounter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Phoebe: It's Phoebe.
Phoebe: Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Phoebe: Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
Phoebe: No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial servicetomorrow.
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Phoebe: Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Phoebe: Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. (Starts to leave.)
Phoebe: Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look,here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Phoebe: (notices his bag.) Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Phoebe: Thanks!
Phoebe: Yeah, welcome.
Phoebe: Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
Phoebe: So how did you know Francis?
Phoebe: Really?! What's your name?
Phoebe: You're Frank Buffay?
Phoebe: You just said
Phoebe: But
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Phoebe: That was my dad!
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." (They stare at her,dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Phoebe: Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He'sgonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
Phoebe: Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person ofFrancis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee houselater.
Phoebe: All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wannasay good-bye to my Grandma.
Phoebe: All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Phoebe: Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Phoebe: Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd thinkI'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Phoebe: All right.
Phoebe: Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Phoebe: As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Phoebe: (seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hatesit! He's in pain!
Phoebe: Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
Phoebe: Come, sit. (He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits onthe arm of the couch.) Umm, all righty, before we get started I justI need you tostate for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Huh?
Phoebe: Oh yes. Yes. Yeahno. She did. She left you umm, (looking in herpurse) this lipstick.
Phoebe: Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out myofficial forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1) Youand uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Phoebe: Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium,or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Phoebe: Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.)
Phoebe: Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A.Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad,bad man?
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Phoebe: Lilly's dead. (He looks up in shock.)
Phoebe: She's dead.
Phoebe: Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
Phoebe: 17 years ago.
Phoebe: Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe,(pause) is on this couch.
Phoebe: Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Phoebe: Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Phoebe: Y'know what, it doesnt matter what you say it's not gonna make adifference anyway, so you can just go.
Phoebe: That's a defense?
Phoebe: You make up songs?
Phoebe: Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)
Phoebe: Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)
Phoebe: (looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy isputting stuff in boxes!
Phoebe: It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'mgonna beat you to it.
Phoebe: (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Startsyelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothesoff.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!

Phoebe: You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry orgoing grocery shopping orOh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Lindafrom camp!
Phoebe: Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. Shemight be able to do better.
Phoebe: Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachelknows?
Phoebe: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of ourown.
Phoebe: Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundrywe'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Phoebe: No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Phoebe: Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Phoebe: And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. Mysexuality.
Phoebe: Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
Phoebe: Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Phoebe: (feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so softhello Mr. Bicep!Have you been working out?
Phoebe: Well, if you really wanna know, I'mOh! I can't tell you this.
Phoebe: Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the oneperson I want to the most.
Phoebe: I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long andhow sometimes you're looking for something and you just dont even see that it'sright there in front of you sipping coffeeOh no, have I said to much? Well it's justsomething to think about. I know I will.
Phoebe: I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)
Phoebe: But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did yousend?
Phoebe: Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (Shepinches his butt.)
Phoebe: Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Phoebe: He broke that.
Phoebe: I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Phoebe: (in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.
Phoebe: Eh?
Phoebe: Really?
Phoebe: I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Phoebe: No!
Phoebe: God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess withus?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,you can't say anything!
Phoebe: All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. Allright, I'm gonna go in.

Phoebe: So, here we are. Nervous?
Phoebe: No, I want this to happen.
Phoebe: Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestiveand seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)
Phoebe: Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna ripthat sweater vest right off!
Phoebe: Really?
Phoebe: No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and haveyou rub lotion on me.
Phoebe: He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Phoebe: Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didnt rip off any buttons.
Phoebe: Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and isshowcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.

Phoebe: You're-you're what?!
Phoebe: I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were inlove!

Phoebe: Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.

Phoebe: No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see youtalking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Yeah, okay, my bad.
Phoebe: (ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying.(Laughs.)
Phoebe: Ooh. (Turns to him.)
Phoebe: No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, allright? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
Phoebe: Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get somesympathy.
Phoebe: But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
Phoebe: Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that becauseI don't totally understand what happened there.
Phoebe: Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Phoebe: All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something thatI would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand andPhoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-hedidn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likesRoss," and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with youguys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him Isaw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying isdon't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now,but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mindnumbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 somethingwoman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv!So, I think you all know what I mean.
Phoebe: Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I justthought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then youcould look like the hero.
Phoebe: Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello toyou last week.
Phoebe: All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel!(Donates it.) How much more do we need?
Phoebe: Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; thiscould take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Ohmy God, this is a police badge!
Phoebe: Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'mat the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzyhas been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers inhope.)
Phoebe: Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? 
Phoebe: You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Phoebe: No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
Phoebe: Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
Phoebe: Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book'em.
Phoebe: Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, youapologize to the tree.
Phoebe: You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (Thewoman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!
Phoebe: Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
Phoebe: so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide.(Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!
Phoebe: I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Phoebe: You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare ather.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads forthe door just as Joey enters.)
Phoebe: (To Joey) Hey.
Phoebe: Excuse me, is this your car?
Phoebe: Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you'reblocking the entrance. 
Phoebe: Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'causeI'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)
Phoebe: Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can parkanywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work.10-4. (Tries to leave.)
Phoebe: I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Phoebe: I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Phoebe: Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Phoebe: Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
Phoebe: (starts to walk away, but stops) Dont try to call him or anything,'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Phoebe: I-I sure will, take care. (Starts walking off.)
Phoebe: Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runsaway.)
Phoebe: Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Phoebe: Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me.(They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luckChandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. Butyou'll never make it stick and you know it!
Phoebe: Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and oncehe puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
Phoebe: I would love it if I weren't here!
Phoebe: Me?!
Phoebe: Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!

Phoebe: Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Phoebe: Okay. (They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What didI ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)
Phoebe: Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
Phoebe: But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'causesome guy shot at a store clerk.
Phoebe: Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Phoebe: All right, you go. (They kiss.)
Phoebe: 'Kay, bye!
Phoebe: Oh God!

Phoebe: We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Phoebe: What are you talking about?!

Phoebe: (noticing her) Oh, look! Look! Look!
Phoebe: I was in charge of cups.
Phoebe: I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Phoebe: Don't get me started on that.
Phoebe: Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Phoebe: (looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okayRoss, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
Phoebe: See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.

Phoebe: But I already gave them back to you!
Phoebe: All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said.(Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?
Phoebe: Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Phoebe: Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Phoebe: (she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?
Phoebe: No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
Phoebe: Ohh! I did not get that.
Phoebe: Did you find it?
Phoebe: Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Phoebe: (To Rachel) What are we going to do?!
Phoebe: All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.

Phoebe: Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really agood story.
Phoebe: Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war inany way. (Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy youall. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey.
Phoebe: I'm fine, thanks.

Phoebe: I don't know. I'll just handle itI'll ask you to talk to him!
Phoebe: Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make himscared like you! Make him aman!
Phoebe: Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thingyou can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Phoebe: Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out ofhere, good for nothing.
Phoebe: Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)
Phoebe: Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Phoebe: No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just stayingstill. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.) 
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I meanthere's so much we don't know about each other.
Phoebe: I justI don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Phoebe: I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm justI'm worriedit's gonna be a big mistake.
Phoebe: Which is why my answer is yes!
Phoebe: Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm sohappy. (She's not happy.)
Phoebe: We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Phoebe: I know, I'm so excited!
Phoebe: Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the mostexcited!
Phoebe: Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Phoebe: I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I doreally like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all themoney I'll save on stamps.
Phoebe: No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost ofstamps. Don't they?
Phoebe: Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Phoebe: No, nothing.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn'thave a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)
Phoebe: Uh-huh!
Phoebe: (sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
Phoebe: Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?
Phoebe: Umm, yeah! Today's.
Phoebe: (looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were justbragging!
Phoebe: Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I havedoubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: That's so sweet.
Phoebe: Living with you would make me happy.
Phoebe: No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Phoebe: Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!(Hugs him.) 
Phoebe: Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind theglass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of theserooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!
Phoebe: I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! It's such abeautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh, I can stay here allday.
Phoebe: We could have breakfast in bed
Phoebe: Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no.
Phoebe: (entering) Oh good, you're all up.
Phoebe: Oh yeah, that's over.
Phoebe: He shot a bird!
Phoebe: Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
Phoebe: (catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down onthe table and everyone gasps.)
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
Phoebe: Bye!
Phoebe: (after he's gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. Ididn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Phoebe: I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
Phoebe: Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Phoebe: You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list bythe way?
Phoebe: Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
Phoebe: Ohh-oh, chilling!
Phoebe: Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Phoebe: No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to LasVegas.
Phoebe: Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Phoebe: Yeah, I've been around.
Phoebe: Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with abeard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know ofno man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Phoebe: But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Phoebe: Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you aseries of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Phoebe: Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax.Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter oregg whites?
Phoebe: Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Phoebe: Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Phoebe: No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Phoebe: North route or south route?
Phoebe: Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Phoebe: Oh, this guy again. (She ignores him.)
Phoebe: Umm, no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at atable previously.)
Phoebe: Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Phoebe: Bye!
Phoebe: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Phoebe: Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Phoebe: Well, I can't help you.
Phoebe: Apology accepted.
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: (quietly) Bye, fat ass. 
Phoebe: I don't know! I don't remember!
Phoebe: Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fatass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney. 
Phoebe: No.
Phoebe: No that made me feel precious.
Phoebe: That game should not be played without my supervision. 
Phoebe: What's in the bag?
Phoebe: I do!
Phoebe: Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!
Phoebe: Hey, dude!
Phoebe: Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanksJoey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)
Phoebe: Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering (We hear the dialtone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Phoebe: No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Phoebe: Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause thatwhy he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Phoebe: Fauna.
Phoebe: Garfunkle.
Phoebe: You said I was boring--Ohh!
Phoebe: Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
Phoebe: Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playingchess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were CameronDiaz! (Realizes) Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Phoebe: Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie? 
Phoebe: (smiles) Okay! (Goes to answer the phone.)
Phoebe: (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Joey!
Phoebe: Sure! Where is it?
Phoebe: Ohh! So you're 5639?!
Phoebe: (to Joey) Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
Phoebe: Who was that?
Phoebe: Yeah! (She hands the phone to Chandler.)
Phoebe: Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! (Starts looking around for her) Monica?(Goes into Monica's bedroom.)
Phoebe: (saddened) It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Phoebe: Which Richard?
Phoebe: Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Phoebe: Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Phoebe: That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Phoebe: But again, Simmons. Go on.
Phoebe: Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
Phoebe: Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
Phoebe: On a totally different bet.
Phoebe: Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Phoebe: Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Phoebe: Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Phoebe: Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas tosurprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Phoebe: Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includesme!
Phoebe: Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
Phoebe: Naked alone time.
Phoebe: Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
Phoebe: So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip toLondon?
Phoebe: Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each onefrom her purse.)
Phoebe: Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be rightback. (Gets up and heads aft.)
Phoebe: (sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about theRichard thing.
Phoebe: Oh no. [The patented version.]
Phoebe: (To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Phoebe: Okay, London 1
Phoebe: Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so muchbetter than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steakand lobster dinner. Huh!
Phoebe: For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settledown here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey inhis gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!
Phoebe: Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.)Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)
Phoebe: Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Phoebe: So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Phoebe: Monica had lunch with Richard.
Phoebe: Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Phoebe: I love Vegas!
Phoebe: Thanks.
Phoebe: Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship withChandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am sosorry.
Phoebe: So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell himthat you're sorry and that you love him.
Phoebe: Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas,number one!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Didyou guys make up?
Phoebe: But she just came up here!
Phoebe: I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Phoebe: Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when shecame back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Phoebe: Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gottafind her.
Phoebe: Good. (After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checksherself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!
Phoebe: (sees Ross and Rachel) Hey!
Phoebe: You guys are here! Yay!
Phoebe: (sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guessumm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at theslot machine Phoebe was just at.)
Phoebe: Yeah! (Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel's"make-up.")
Phoebe: Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Phoebe: Ugh!
Phoebe: That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Phoebe: M-M-Mole people?
Phoebe: Oh. What's a lurker?
Phoebe: Kills you?
Phoebe: Ohhh!
Phoebe: How do you know about this?
Phoebe: Dance karate?
Phoebe: (seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get!(She throws a quarter at her.)
Phoebe: Ohh! You made up!
Phoebe: Ohh, get a room.
Phoebe: I know. Use it.
Phoebe: Oh well, lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurkerscurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches herin the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!
Phoebe: Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guardwalks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurkingdays are over!
Phoebe: Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move onto someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll beon your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When doyou leave?
Phoebe: What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
Phoebe: I won! I won! I finally won!
Phoebe: Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! (Gives back her quarter.)
Phoebe: (quietly) Sells drugs to kids.
Phoebe: She sells drugs to kids. (The guard looks at the lurker.)
Phoebe: How about we talk about this over dinner?
Phoebe: No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back tothat hell hole!!
Phoebe: Oh, okay. (Walks out.)
Phoebe: (entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is ReginaPhalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looksdown) Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
Phoebe: Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact samehands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Phoebe: No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
Phoebe: Okay! Okay! Okay! (They run into the chapel.)
Phoebe: (to her) Hey! Dont you give me any of yourHey! (SeesChandler and Monica standing there.)
Phoebe: Well, maybe you wouldnt have had you (turns to the attendant) runin the chapel!
Phoebe: Whats the big deal, yknow? Its not like its areal marriage.
Phoebe: Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas.
Phoebe: (shocked) Really?! 
Phoebe: Oh my God!Eh! Well
Phoebe: Oh Joey, Im so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Phoebe: What about my cab?
Phoebe: No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
Phoebe: I dont know, its such a long trip.
Phoebe: Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Phoebe: All right. Although I dont think we need one, I never stoppedloving you.
Phoebe: Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Phoebe: Well you dont.
Phoebe: Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Phoebe: No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. 
Phoebe: Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Phoebe: Hell, Im drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? Icant have a mimosa with breakfast?! Im on vacation!
Phoebe: Oh-oh, thats your thing.
Phoebe: Youre thing. Youre thing. Yknow? Youre the guywho gets divorced.
Phoebe: Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so muchyoure probably gonna marry it! Then it wont work out and youre gonnahave to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) Im so drunk.
Phoebe: Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Comeon Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any (sees that hes asleep) QUESTIONS!!!
Phoebe: Well, you promised me a fun road trip! Weve been on the road sixhours and youve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next reststop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, yougreedy sleeper!
Phoebe: Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because theradios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Phoebe: Sing!!
Phoebe: (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be arape(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhikers face), a rapist or akiller or something!
Phoebe: Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (Tothe hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!
Phoebe: Do you like car games?
Phoebe: I love the license plate game!
Phoebe: No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes thepartition.) 
Phoebe: Oh, okay.
Phoebe: And I have your name and the fact that youre a drifter, so theballs pretty much in your court.
Phoebe: Stop it! Stop it no! Thats not fair! Yknow I cantresist that beautiful voice!
Phoebe: You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Phoebe: Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Phoebe: Is it a meatball sub?
Phoebe: No thanks, Ive already seen one.
Phoebe: Always.
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Always.
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: (running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you forjust a second?
Phoebe: Oh, theres a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.)Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.) 
Phoebe: Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cabs roof and itpulls away.) (To Ross) You didnt get the annulment?!!
Phoebe: Ross?!
Phoebe: Dont be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever youwant it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Yknow? Minesgonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Phoebe: So okay what? Youre gonna be married to a girl who doesnteven know about it?!Op, woman! Sorry.
Phoebe: Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the onlyone who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Phoebe: Hey Rach!
Phoebe: Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
Phoebe: Well then youd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on theroof again and off they go.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: No, why?
Phoebe: (gasps) Youre pregnant!
Phoebe: Ooh! Thats good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would youname it? Hint: Phoebe.
Phoebe: Guys, Im happy too.
Phoebe: Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled (Winksat Ross.)
Phoebe: Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel Bad news for Rachel, what couldthat be?!
Phoebe: Ross, its not that big a deal! So youll been divorced threetimes, youll still have a life, youll go on dates
Phoebe: Ross, youre being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart andsweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Phoebe: Yknow thats really fair. Yknow? Most guys who havebeen divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-thisembarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, Ill show you! Come here.
Phoebe: (to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorcedfor the third time, but wouldnt you date him?
Phoebe: Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldnt be interested? Whowouldnt want to date him?
Phoebe: Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldnt you want a date?
Phoebe: (interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?
Phoebe: (leaning to him) She said, "Hes obviously still in love withthis Rachel girl." (He glares at her.)
Phoebe: Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
Phoebe: Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!! 
Phoebe: Yes, and now hes using this three divorces reason because he wantsto stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Phoebe: (to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!
Phoebe: So? Did you get the annulment?
Phoebe: I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
Phoebe: Yeah, complicated cause of the love.
Phoebe: Ive never been more convinced of your love for her.
Phoebe: Oh we do, but not just yet.
Phoebe: Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthyrich by the way. Yeah. But it wont work out.
Phoebe: I know. Then, Im gonna marry Chandler for the money andyoull marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Phoebe: But then we ditch those two and thats when we get married.Well have Chandlers money and Rachels kids and getting custody will beeasy because of Rachels drinking problem.
Phoebe: I dont want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words andI kill him.
Phoebe: Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding hisbreath for almost four minutes! 
Phoebe: Uh-huh, what?
Phoebe: Oh!
Phoebe: Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Phoebe: My roommate.
Phoebe: Yes, Denise. Denise! 
Phoebe: Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about herall the time! DENISE!!!!!
Phoebe: Hey.
Phoebe: So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Phoebe: You didnt tell her did you?
Phoebe: Of course not, because youre in love with her.
Phoebe: What do you mean, comforted her?
Phoebe: Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Phoebe: Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out ofRosss cookie.)
Phoebe: Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Phoebe: Ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of herhead! Thats why, thats why women are shorter. So that men will fall in lovewhen they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, youre ascientist. 
Phoebe: (taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, allright? Rachels not in the same place you are.
Phoebe: Okay, I didnt understand that, but yknow, maybe thatscause you were speaking the secret language of love! 
Phoebe: Shhhhhh! Im swamped right now.
Phoebe: Umm, Im trying to move that pencil. (Theres a pencil lyingon the table.)
Phoebe: It worked!
Phoebe: Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) "Two bedroom,two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay" Oh, yeah, but its onthe ground floor.
Phoebe: I saw it.
Phoebe: Umm, Im talking about that which you already know but wontadmit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Phoebe: I cant believe you wont just admit it! (Pause) Okay, justpromise me that you wont do anything stupid.
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Wow! Im-Im so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so,not stupid.
Phoebe: No. No, I wont. But I should tell you this, this exact same thinghappened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to herand he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! Andthats how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay,thats a lie.
Phoebe: (singing) I found you in my bed!                          Howd you whined up there?                          You are a mystery!                         Little black curly hair!                         Little black curly hair!                         Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curlyhair
Phoebe: Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then pleasegive me money so I can buy a computer.
Phoebe: (on the microphone, accidentally) Yes.
Phoebe: Ross, I know what youre thinking.
Phoebe: That shes gonna move in with you and maybe then shell fallin love with you and then when she finds out youre already married, shell justbe happy. Yknow? Youre just, youre very sad.
Phoebe: What?!!
Phoebe: No! (Rosss phone rings.)
Phoebe: Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
Phoebe: Oh! Yeah, yknow you and Ross are still married.
Phoebe: Just kidding!
Phoebe: (To Ross) Saved your ass.
Phoebe: Hi.
Phoebe: Well, you know that psychic I see?
Phoebe: Well, she told me that Im gonna die this week, so Im kindabummed about that.
Phoebe: Yeah, and I know you guys dont know a lot about psychic readings,but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Phoebe: I dontshe said yknow that Id have triplets! Butshe also said one of them would be black.
Phoebe: No, cause she didnt tell me I was gonna die until the veryend of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean Iveonly got a week left, yknow? Ive really gotta start living now! (So shepicks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, andstarts reading.)
Phoebe: Oh, this is it. This whats gonna kill me.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Ugh, its so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way,do you think you could(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and hertongue hanging out.)
Phoebe: I was preparing you for mydidnt you think I was dead? Didthat not come off?
Phoebe: Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm,wake me up in a couple hours, yknow if you can.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Whats going on?
Phoebe: Hey! Maybe youll die!
Phoebe: No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay?Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday.
Phoebe: No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Listen to this! My reading was wrong, Im not going die!
Phoebe: Because my psychic is dead! She mustve read the cards wrong!
Phoebe: Eh, better her than me! Hey, lets bake cookies!
Phoebe: Have you really done this before?
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Phoebe: (overdoing it) Oh my God!!
Phoebe: Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Phoebe: Another lie. You have a sickness!
Phoebe: (coming in from the bathroom) Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen,how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Phoebe: Okay, well Ill bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, bythe way, theyre not actually puppies, theyre Frank and Alices triplets.Okay, see ya! (Exits.)
Phoebe: (stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frankand Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and Im nervous cause Ivenever done that before by myself!
Phoebe: What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while,I dont have a roommate.
Phoebe: Maybe you could be my roommate!
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Umm, she said shed be back December 26th. 
Phoebe: (rapidly) Im doing okay. I think its going well. Do youthink theyre having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Phoebe: Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Phoebe: That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Phoebe: Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: I dont know why I was so nervous about this. And I dont knowwhy Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Phoebe: No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, lookat his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up.
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Phoebe: Oh, I can still do that.
Phoebe: How did that happen?!!
Phoebe: Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Phoebe: What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them!Were baby-sitting! 
Phoebe: But you-you cant leave me with them! We-were a team!Were playing a zone! Theyre gonna triple team me!
Phoebe: But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its justgonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
Phoebe: Im pretty sure its gun.
Phoebe: A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital! (They dontstop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)
Phoebe: Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right?Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I getrid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one. (She throws it atthe garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to thefloor and break.) Okay, Im sorry. I didnt mean to scare you. I just have toclean that up. Okay? Cause lets face it, were at Monicas. (Shecrawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. Allright. Well, thats just the way that goes.

Phoebe: What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if hesmarried? (Rachel looks at her.) No, yeah, I should.
Phoebe: Hey. Here. (Hands Chandler a copy of her flyer and sees the picture ofRalph.) Ohh, whos the silver fox?
Phoebe: Thats not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
Phoebe: Yeah, no, Ralph doesnt look anything like that guy.Hes-hes young and hes got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Phoebe: Ohhh.
Phoebe: Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (Hesmiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Phoebe: But why didnt you just tell her the truth.
Phoebe: Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? Youknow. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did sheever think of that?

Phoebe: And who else is going to be there?
Phoebe: Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not veryThanksgivingy.
Phoebe: Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller lastnight.
Phoebe: Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was sobrave and so strong! And its making me look at him totally differently. Yknow,I mean he used to be just, yknow Jack Geller Monica and Rosss dadand now hes hes Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Phoebe: Rachel?
Phoebe: Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldntgive to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.
Phoebe: Monica, leave him alone!
Phoebe: So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isnt it?
Phoebe: Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Phoebe: I cant have any. You know I dont eat meat. (Fakingdissapointment.) Ohhh no.
Phoebe: Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down onthe lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I hadanother dream about Jack.
Phoebe: I dunno, lets see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna getmarried, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a nightclub, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Phoebe: Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betrayingme! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse,who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Phoebe: Five minutes ago, a line like that wouldve floored me. Nownothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.

Phoebe: All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wetpaper towels.)
Phoebe: God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monicas.)
Phoebe: Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Phoebe: Yknow, this is probably none of my business, but werent youguys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Phoebe: Oh, sly.
Phoebe: (interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Phoebe: Oh thats good, I guess shell have a choice between my guyand your weirdo.
Phoebe: Cause thats just your taste.
Phoebe: Oh yeah?
Phoebe: My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (Shesqueezes the skin on her chin together to form)
Phoebe: A chin dimple!
Phoebe: Have you seen your guys body?
Phoebe: Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? Hes a massage client and onetime umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
Phoebe: Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
Phoebe: I know. (Laughs.)
Phoebe: Oh, Chandler funny?
Phoebe: My guy is well read.
Phoebe: My guy has great teeth!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: What did you do on yours?
Phoebe: Rachel, what the hell is this?!
Phoebe: You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with yourown!
Phoebe: Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Phoebe: So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Phoebe: No reason, its just I know a single guy that cares about otherpeople.
Phoebe: Well, so do a lot of people.
Phoebe: Yeah, yknow what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that thekind of guy youd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like todance?" (Imitates him.) "Uhh, okayI gotta go!"
Phoebe: Yeah! What have you got to lose? Yknow you might even end up withsomeone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.
Phoebe: Okay sure!
Phoebe: Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on yourlast ten auditions.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Ross, you cant tell her not to go. You just started dating.
Phoebe: Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Phoebe: This is Patrick. (Points to him.)
Phoebe: (looks) Oh my God, youre right! I am too late; theyresitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.)Rachel?
Phoebe: This is Patrick.
Phoebe: Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about. 
Phoebe: Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to whatsunderneath it.
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Oh! Okay! Yeah, thats okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (SitsPatrick down next to Rachel.)
Phoebe: Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.
Phoebe: Yeah, okay, lets talk it out.
Phoebe: Then why did she ask us to
Phoebe: Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Phoebe: Oh my God, look! Thats Elizabeth!
Phoebe: Youve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
Phoebe: Dont worry about me, Im a robot! Im just a machine!!
Phoebe: (she stops reading from the script) Oh my God.
Phoebe: I am extremely talented!
Phoebe: (interrupting) No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Phoebe: Oh yeah, youre solid. Yeah, youre just no me.
Phoebe: (tremendously overacting) Fine! Ill do it without you! (Joey givesher thumbs up) I dont need you or anybody else! Im gonna make it on my own!(Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) Youll see!! Youll all see!! 
Phoebe: I am.
Phoebe: (overacting with a song this time) (singing) Gooood luck! Goooodluck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Phoebe:  Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...(The flashback shows Paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving hishands up Phoebe's legs and grabbing her butt.)
Phoebe:  And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Theflashback shows Paulo rolling over and showing Phoebe his equipment.)
Phoebe:  Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
Phoebe:  It's not that bad.
Phoebe:  Chandler, Chandler.
Phoebe: Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!
Phoebe: Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!
Phoebe: OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Phoebe: I know!  I know!  I know! 
Phoebe: Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Phoebe: There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be,like, my bitches.
Phoebe: (overacting badly) I cant! My circuits are fried! Theyrefried I tell you!!
Phoebe: I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like,"Ooh, whered Ross go?"
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: (To Ross) Hes holding us back.
Phoebe: No! Joey, youre going to be great!
Phoebe: (in a sexy voice to Chandler) Ill be waiting.
Phoebe: No, Im just deciding which one to useIm gonna startwriting another book!
Phoebe: Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only onewho has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received. 
Phoebe: Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
Phoebe: I want to see what he wants first.
Phoebe: Youre Elizabeths father, huh? I can see now where she getsher rugged handsomeness.
Phoebe: Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)
Monica and Phoebe: (sympathetic) Ohh!
Phoebe: (writing frantically) You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk alittle slower? 
Phoebe: Yeah, its about relationships. Yknow? The traps, thepitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
Phoebe: And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.(Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long asits a compliment.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Well, why dont you just get him fired?
Phoebe: (writing in her book) "You wish."
Phoebe: Im not writing about you! Im writing about other people.
Phoebe: Marcia and Chester.
Phoebe: I see what youre doing!
Phoebe: Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Phoebe: (Turning around in the chair) Hi!
Phoebe: I know what time you said.
Phoebe: Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Phoebe: Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly its my book to therescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clearsthings up.
Phoebe: I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Phoebe: Thanks! So are you.
Phoebe: (reading from her book) Mon (Pause as she restarts) Marcia andChester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks theyresupposed to meet at six, Chester thinks its at seven.
Phoebe: Thats right.
Phoebe: (writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Phoebe: (dejected) Hi, you guys.
Phoebe: Well its justits one of those situations that I justhate. Yknow? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit atthe Morgan Chase museum.
Phoebe: No! No! Its just that he gave me three tickets and there are sixof us!
Phoebe: Okay thats so generous!
Phoebe: Great! Okay then its just us girls!
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Its mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersedwith video games and free sandwiches.
Phoebe: Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall offame! Eek!
Phoebe: (gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put younext to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; wed be greattogether!
Phoebe: So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauers clothes here? Maybe?Just ones that havent been cleaned yet? 
Phoebe: Hey, and then lunch.
Phoebe: Oh wow. What, do you think maybe hes gonna tell you that hesgay?
Phoebe: No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
Phoebe: Yeah, but theres a two-year wait. And then what if you get engagedin two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. Thatsfour years. Chandlers not gonna wait that long. Hes gonna find somebody else,yknow? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)
Phoebe: Me too!
Phoebe: I dont know, I dont have anyone right now. Yknow?
Phoebe: Dont feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isnt gay.
Phoebe: Dont even get me started on yours!
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: No! Why?
Phoebe: Well for the regular guy, its bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
Phoebe: What are you gonna do?
Phoebe: Rachel said that!
Phoebe: Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did yousign it, "Son of a bitch?" (Son of a bitch is written across the entirepicture.)
Phoebe: Okay, maybe ask this guy.
Phoebe: Well, what did he do?
Phoebe: Joey!
Phoebe: Well, we should go.
Phoebe: (entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?
Phoebe: So did Heldi show you the place?
Phoebe: I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Phoebe: Now, have you told anyone else?
Phoebe: You told me.
Phoebe: Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadntbeen on the toilet.
Phoebe: Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? 
Phoebe: Yeah, coffeehouse.
Phoebe: So how are things going with Paul?
Phoebe: Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of picklesthat wont open.
Phoebe: No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out ofsomeone.
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Watch this.
Phoebe: Hi Paul!
Phoebe: So how are things going with you?
Phoebe: Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Phoebe: I didnt do it! It was Chandler! Hes Hes mad atyou!
Phoebe: Please, I think you know why.
Phoebe: Come on Ross, youre a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Phoebe: Do you think thats something that hed be mad at you for?
Phoebe: Well then I think thats it.
Phoebe: Oh, if thats what you want you then you really should run his headunder hot water and bang his head against a table.
Phoebe: Okay, so maybe you dont get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you dosomething different. Yknow? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, yknow?Or an engagement tiara? Orooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one upfrom the display in the corner.
Phoebe: Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her thisgorgeous piece of weaponry?
Phoebe: (coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is,this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this fromhere on out.
Phoebe: Or not, whatever.
Phoebe: Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?
Phoebe: We will give you $10.
Phoebe: We stand firm at $10.
Phoebe: Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, Im sorry about before. Do you haveanything her for $10.
Phoebe: Ill give you $1 for them.
Phoebe: Okay umm, Id also like to try on the tiara. (The male jewelerhands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, toomuch?
Phoebe: Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (Hehands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Somethingsmissing. Its not Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Phoebe: Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, whichlocks the stores door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No!What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)
Phoebe: Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)
Phoebe: Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!
Phoebe: Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they (pointsto the jeweler) put me in jail!
Phoebe: The little jail between the doors!
Phoebe: I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monicanever even saw the other ring.
Phoebe: Maybe it was the guy.
Phoebe: (entering from her room) Hey.
Phoebe: Its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! Its abeautiful ring!
Phoebe: Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back.Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe wecan get him to trade rings or something.
Phoebe: Well you certainly cant give her that stupid gumball ring.
Phoebe: There he is! (Points.)
Phoebe: Wow! Youre good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Phoebe: Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with meplease? You have a phone call.
Phoebe: It is your office.
Phoebe: John?
Phoebe: (To Chandler) Here he is.
Phoebe: Wow! I would trade.
Phoebe: Yeah, do you want to break a dying womans heart?
Phoebe: Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if Im notburied with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for alleternity
Phoebe: (entering) Hi.
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: If she says no, can I have the ring?
Phoebe: If!
Phoebe: (with her mouthful) Hi Monica.
Phoebe: Its gone.
Phoebe: (To Chandler) Were practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face andwinks at him.)
Phoebe: Open bar?
Phoebe: I can do that for the kids.
Phoebe: Yknow, you are 12 years older than her.
Phoebe: Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)
Phoebe: Here.
Phoebe: So now whats going on here?
Phoebe: No, I know what a silent is I meant, whats going on with yourhair?
Phoebe: No! Its nice!
Phoebe: Oh, hi. (They shake hands.)
Phoebe: Hey you guys! Look! 
Phoebe: I got me some drinks!
Phoebe: Open bar!
Phoebe: You just cant stand anyone else enjoying themselves cantyou?
Phoebe: Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applaudingagain. Joey waves and does a salute.] 
Phoebe: Well, just buy the damn boat! (Shes still working her way throughher tray of booze.)
Phoebe: Im just helping the kids!
Phoebe: Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Phoebe: Oh, okay.
Phoebe: Its a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-typethingy shes wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.)Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Phoebe: Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he onlyshakes it.) 
Phoebe: Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is franticallytrying to wave them off.)
Phoebe: I wanna see whats in your hand. I wanna see the trash. 
Phoebe: Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out.
Phoebe: What happened?
Phoebe: Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor
Phoebe: Good one! Yeah.
Phoebe: Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesnt know for sure,so just throw her off the track.
Phoebe: Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that youre scared of commitment!Convince her that youre a little coward!
Phoebe: No, youre too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Phoebe: I know, theyre gonna be so happy together.
Phoebe: Not that often!
Phoebe: Me too! So happy for them!
Phoebe: Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
Phoebe: Totally. Im like 90/10.
Phoebe: Definitely!
Phoebe: What do you mean?
Phoebe: You mean a backup?
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah I got that.
Phoebe: Hm-mmm.
Phoebe: Joey.
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Phoebe: Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted toseal the deal.
Phoebe: Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were (She makes two clickingsounds with her tongue and purrs.)
Phoebe: Well hey, its just a backup.
Phoebe: Of course I can! Its just good sense to backup your backup! Look,Ive already lost Chandler!
Phoebe: I dontLook I dont know what youre complainingabout now? You were both aware of the situation!
Phoebe: Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when were married!
Phoebe: All right well lets see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has aboatThis is hard!
Phoebe: No wait! JustOkayJust wait! You guys! Wait you guys!Dont make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married,three times a week.
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Im talking about massages.
Phoebe: Good!
Phoebe: Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfoldand read them.) Thank you.
Phoebe: (reading) Ross!
Phoebe: Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)
Phoebe: Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isnt here!
Phoebe: Oh no, let her stay out there. Its sweet.
Phoebe: So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, yknow,Im kinda musical.
Phoebe: Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down myapartment?
Phoebe: Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Phoebe: Oh honey no, you ate it all.
Phoebe: Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.(Singing) 
Phoebe: If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hesprobably not gay.
Phoebe: Im sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding.Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)
Phoebe: Really?! Oh thats so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon,if you touch my guitar again Ill have to pound on you for a little bit.
Phoebe: Okay. (She goes to get ready.)
Phoebe: You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you gettingback together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Phoebe: What a great night, Chandler cant do it, these guys kissed(Points to Ross and Rachel.)
Phoebe: Well yeah, that and Chandlers problem.
Phoebe: Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, well get us some Mai Thais,(To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.
Phoebe: Why?!
Phoebe: (shes strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I thinkIll play it at the wedding.
Phoebe: Well, I dont think Monica is gonna take this away.
Phoebe: Would she?
Phoebe: Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, Im just gonna needa small deposit.
Phoebe: Yknow, just some good faith money to hold the date.
Phoebe: Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)
Phoebe: Yknow, I dont really their permission.
Phoebe: Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you You gotta do somethingabout your eyes.
Phoebe: They give you away! Theres just-theres just too much wisdomin there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Phoebe: Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Phoebe: (singing, angrily) 
Phoebe: (singing)
Phoebe: Oh thank you.
Phoebe: Now (Starts singing again) "Who will perform the ceremony!Who will perform the cer(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes thedoor behind him)Ohoh! All right, Ill pound on him in the morning.
Phoebe: It starts?
Phoebe: That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break itoff now.
Phoebe: Hey! Ross!
Phoebe: I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monicaand Chandler.
Phoebe: Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys justgot engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow? So, could Ijust move in with you for a couple days?
Phoebe: NothingWhy?!
Phoebe: Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like fiveminutes.
Phoebe: (to the students) Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone wantto come to the movies?
Phoebe: Oh Ross, hi.
Phoebe: Im sorry, Im with a client right now.
Phoebe: Okay, lets talk outside.
Phoebe: Whats the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandlers!
Phoebe: (pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Phoebe: Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. Ijust dont know what the big deal is!
Phoebe: (gasps) My God! What did you order?!
Phoebe: Look, why dont you just pay for it yourself?
Phoebe: (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr.Chandler.
Phoebe: Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Phoebe: (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Phoebe: My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guythat worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Phoebe: He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Phoebe: Well, hes never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollarsa week!
Phoebe: Oh, its my fault?! You didnt have to massage him! Youcouldve sent him away! You couldve not rolled Tonka trucks up and downhis back!
Phoebe: So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Phoebe: Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Phoebe: You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Phoebe: You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed thatI would never let out of our family?
Phoebe: Break my heartOh, all right.
Phoebe: If you dont sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Phoebe: Your own boat?
Phoebe: I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and thestupid fire burned it up!
Phoebe: (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because Im normal!That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as anengagement present.
Phoebe: Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookiein a plastic baggie.) 
Phoebe: See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Phoebe: Why not?
Phoebe: Really?!
Phoebe: You do?
Phoebe: That and arrogance.
Monica and Phoebe: No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Phoebe: I cant believe that! Now the only thing left of mygrandmothers legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it outto Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Phoebe: Come on, its not that big a deal!
Phoebe: Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Phoebe: Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Phoebe: Are there anymore from the good batch? Cause we could just workoff of those.
Phoebe: Yknow, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy toknow that were trying to figure out her recipe. I bet shes l-l-lookin upat us and smiling right now.
Phoebe: Oh yeahNo, she was really nice to me, but shes in hell forsure.
Phoebe: Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talkto Ursula would be over my dead body. And thats not happening til October 15th,2032.
Phoebe: Thats what you think.
Phoebe: Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. Mygrandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
Phoebe: Nesele Toulouse.
Phoebe: Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Phoebe: (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.
Phoebe: I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down)youre burning in hell!!
Phoebe: I dont know. I dont know. I cant lie to him again. Ohno Ino! Im just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Phoebe: Uh-huh, yeah thats right.
Phoebe: What? You mean behind my back?
Monica and Phoebe: Oh, thats great!!
Phoebe: (gasps) Oh God!
Phoebe: Oh hey!
Monica and Phoebe: Ahhh!!
Phoebe: (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Phoebe: Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You dont hirean assistant because theyre cute, you hire them because theyre qualified.
Phoebe: Lets see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh But no! No!You cant-you cant hire him, because thatits not professional. Umm,this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)
Phoebe: HeyOoh, hows Hilda? Is she working out?
Phoebe: Sorry.
Phoebe: What happened?
Phoebe: You! An actor?! Thats madness!
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: You must be Hilda.
Phoebe: Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Phoebe: So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Phoebe: But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Phoebe: Oh Willies still alive!
Phoebe: Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the Statueof Liberty.
Phoebe: Hey, why dont you guys go, get portraits done by a professionalphotographer.
Phoebe: Yeah thats great! Next to that, Chandler wont look sostupid.
Phoebe: (returning) Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Phoebe: He is! But hes getting divorcedRoss! Maybe you know him.
Phoebe: You dont have to be back for a half-hour!
Phoebe: So you wouldnt mind if he was dating someone else?
Phoebe: Im having a really good time!
Phoebe: Ohh. No thats okay, hes a friend.
Phoebe: Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, soId just be lost.
Phoebe: Okay, dont freak out. Ill go.
Phoebe: Okay, I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?
Phoebe: Yeah, umm thats Whitney (Points), Kyles ex-wife out there,now do you think that you can yknow divert her so that we can slip out?
Phoebe: Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (Sheholds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)
Phoebe: Hi Ginger.
Phoebe: I dont have it!
Phoebe: Ugh, okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)
Phoebe: All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for divertingKyles ex. 
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: (To Ross) Kyles ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not dateher!
Phoebe: Watching ballroom dancing?
Phoebe: Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really badstuff about her.
Phoebe: Like shes really mean, and shes over critical,and-andNo! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checkingwith you!
Phoebe: And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Phoebe: Youre still gonna go out with her?!
Phoebe: Well, didnt you just hear what I said?!
Phoebe: (interrupting him) No listen to me! She is crazy!
Phoebe: You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Phoebe: Hi.
Phoebe: So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Phoebe: Yeah well, maybe she shouldve spent a little less time decoratingand a little more time in the bedroom.
Phoebe: You think hes emotionally unavailable?
Phoebe: Well, maybe he wouldnt be she didnt bring the office homeevery night!
Phoebe: Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Years Eve1997.
Phoebe: (gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!
Phoebe: Oh, Im sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfishin bed, hows Whitney?
Phoebe: Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.
Phoebe: Both of you together?
Phoebe: What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Phoebe: Oh right, because youre so capable of change.
Phoebe: Yeah, and yknow what? I dont give a tiny rats ass.
Phoebe: Oh. Yknow, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Phoebe: And yknow, even if they break up again, youd better not lethim in your sad mens club!
Phoebe: Potato, Potaato. (Shes pronounces potato with the both the shortand long As.)
Phoebe: Ooh, lets see it!
Phoebe: You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to ashot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)
Phoebe: I hope its you.
Phoebe: Yes!!! Oh!!
Phoebe: Still.
Phoebe: Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?
Phoebe: Wh-why is that the best part?
Phoebe: Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!
Phoebe: Hey Rachel?
Phoebe: Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Phoebe: Oh! Well, if thats what you want
Phoebe: But why does it even matter?!
Phoebe: Because this one is now! And-and its two of our bestfriends! Who knows what youre gonna marry!
Phoebe: (gasps) You wouldnt! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want todo this, but I-Ive never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know youvedone it at least twice!
Phoebe: And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh Iguess that was it.
Phoebe: Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.
Phoebe: Oh I know.
Phoebe: See? This is exactly why you shouldnt lie!
Phoebe: Na-uh, I am!
Phoebe: Because I cared enough to lie!
Phoebe: What are you talking about?
Phoebe: Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Well, its better than us deciding.
Phoebe: No! Coins hate me!
Phoebe: Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)
Phoebe: Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Phoebe: Yes! Your honor?
Phoebe: Oh!
Phoebe: Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Phoebe: Okay, I cant believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.(Raises her glass and drinks.)
Phoebe: Really?! I won!
Phoebe: The coins have finally forgiven me!
Phoebe: (running after her) Rach, its gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey)You guys are the best!
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Thats ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks ather.) Oh, you mean today.
Phoebe: Oh yeah!
Phoebe: Oh thats so sweet thanks.
Phoebe: Ohh.
Phoebe: This stuff is great!
Phoebe: Yknow Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monicas madeof honor.
Phoebe: Because I think it means more to you.
Phoebe: Its fine. I mean, this is something that youve been thinking aboutsince you were what, 14? (Shes referring to the Halloween picture.)
Phoebe: (looking at the picture again) Man alive!
Phoebe: Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Phoebe: Okay!
Phoebe: And call me!
Phoebe: We want you to marry her!
Phoebe: She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Phoebe: Joey, shes so cool. She speaks four languages.
Phoebe: Yeah, but you always say that.
Phoebe: Whatever.
Phoebe: Secret affair!
Phoebe: (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!
Phoebe: Oh no.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Yay!! Oh so, youre not, youre not mad at us anymore?
Phoebe: Didnt you sleep together?
Phoebe: Then change it back!
Phoebe: No spark? Didnt you sleep together?
Phoebe: Does Joey have any idea?
Phoebe: Yeah, you mean like that youre kind of a loner.
Phoebe: Yeah, and maybe that youre a real (She says something in Italian,and it doesnt matter what she said. Its not important so I dont needeveryone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)
Phoebe: Oh well, I guess Italian isnt one of the four languages you speak.
Phoebe: No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: So how was, how was your date?
Phoebe: Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Phoebe: Hey Joey, yknow what? You are way to good for her.
Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe: Shhhh! 
Phoebe: Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types ofcelery, and I have one: regular celery. 
Phoebe: Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already havethat. (She gets up and heads for her room) 
Phoebe: Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. 
Phoebe: Oh, it's not! 
Phoebe: It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe'sbag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good. 
Phoebe: (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Phoebe: I'm sorry, who's this? 
Phoebe: No, there's no dog here? 
Phoebe: Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)
Phoebe: (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They'rehere already? How are they doing this? 
Phoebe: There's no dog in here. 
Phoebe: No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and thedog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, Ihave a dog in my room. 
Phoebe: Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (Shebends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers.May I please stay with you nice people?
Phoebe: That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days 
Monica and Phoebe: Why? 
Phoebe: Are you crazy? 
Phoebe: Why? 
Phoebe: You don't like ice cream? 
Phoebe: All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Rosss. We'll be back in aminute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)
Phoebe: Oh, I'd say about a month. 
Phoebe: (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely. 
Phoebe: Yeah, okay. 
Phoebe: You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn'teven know. 
Phoebe: I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He'snot so smart. 
Phoebe: Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? 
Phoebe: Where's Chandler? 
Phoebe: Wash your hands!!!
Phoebe: (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now.Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom. 
Phoebe: See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into herroom) 
Phoebe: (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here? 
Phoebe: Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back! 
Phoebe: Oh no, the dog's not going to be there! 
Phoebe: (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe wewon't. 
Phoebe: We have good news, look whose back! 
Phoebe: It's a Thanksgiving miracle! 
Phoebe: Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things shemust have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window withher teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in(Realizes, that Chandler starts tonot believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped? 
Phoebe: His first big kids bike, this is so exciting!
Phoebe: I never had a bike of my own.
Phoebe: Well, we didnt have a lot of money. But the girl across the streethad the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off thehandle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with thoseplastic daisies stuck on.
Phoebe: No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of thebike on the front. (Theyre all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dadwould drag me around the backyard.
Phoebe: Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod,"Oh.")
Phoebe: Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it!
Phoebe: Sure!
Phoebe: (gasps) Oh my God Ross!!
Phoebe: I love it!!
Phoebe: Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Phoebe: Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Phoebe: Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present Iveever gotten.
Phoebe: (starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandlers about to cry.
Phoebe: Oh hi!
Phoebe: Ohh, uh-huh so much!
Phoebe: Of course!
Phoebe: Okay. (The gang is giggles then Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack,gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?
Phoebe: (hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah,maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplaneseator a beanbag chair!
Phoebe: Why? Why do I have to learn?
Phoebe: What kind of an emergency?
Phoebe: Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock thegun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Phoebe: You wont let go?
Phoebe: Swear?!
Phoebe: (thinks it over) Okay. 
Phoebe: All right.
Phoebe: Well
Phoebe: Okay. (Does so.)
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)
Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
Phoebe: I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himselffrom the angry looks from onlookers.)
Phoebe: (seeing him) Oh, hello liar.
Phoebe: I couldve been killed I hope you know!
Phoebe: Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police haveno suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering somethingthat suspiciously looks like a bike.) 
Phoebe: What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!
Phoebe: What?! Why?!
Phoebe: All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Phoebe: (sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike)Please dont die!
Phoebe: I cant believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thoughtId be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Phoebe: Dont be so corny Ross, its not an after-school special. (Sherides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmlyattached.)
Phoebe: (entering carrying a skull) Hey!
Phoebe: Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
Phoebe: Huh?
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
Phoebe: No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, sheused to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, peoplestill die. And, you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick oflicorice, and takes a bite.)
Phoebe: And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how peopledie.
Phoebe: (entering) Oh, hey, you guys!
Phoebe: Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna getready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Phoebe: Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel thegood news.
Phoebe: Yeah, why not?
Phoebe: Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Phoebe: Really? So she said, she didnt wanna live with me anymore?
Phoebe: You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Phoebe: Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. (Chandler and Monica looksurprised) Kind of what probably really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh,"Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow? I'm sorry, but I'm nothanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"Yknow? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In thisworld history teaches us nothing! (Exits)
Phoebe: So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Yknow, I was worried,that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well,apparently not! So, yay!
Phoebe: That's fun. (She exits disappointedly.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! (she sits down next to him)
Phoebe: Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to reactto drums.
Phoebe: Maybe on some level.
Phoebe: (entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got youanother present. (She puts it on the counter)
Phoebe: It's atarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stooljumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big,gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Phoebe: (sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joeyis the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)
Phoebe: Our apartment is ready.
Phoebe: Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Phoebe: Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. Andapparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Phoebe: Hm?
Phoebe: (nods along) Fish!
Phoebe: Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you'rehaving so much fun over here
Phoebe: We did have fun, didn't we?
Phoebe: Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Phoebe: Yay, okay!
Phoebe: Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Phoebe: Oh, this is terrible. Oh, theyve made so many changes I canteven feel my grandmothers presence anymoreOoh! New sconces!
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!
Phoebe: Well, I guess well just have to put the wall back up.
Phoebe: Theres a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.)Wow!!
Phoebe: (returning slowly) Yknow Im-Im sensing that um, mygrandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Phoebe: A little bit, yeah.
Phoebe: You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Phoebe: Are you sure?
Phoebe: Oh me too.
Phoebe: No, I do not hear that.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there aporcupine at the Easter Bunnys funeral?
Phoebe: Absolutely!
Phoebe: Okay. (Joey exits.) 
Phoebe: Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month todiscuss the rest of you guys.
Phoebe: Duly noted.
Phoebe: Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Phoebe: Well, Ill tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joeytonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)
Phoebe: Oh thats a nickname we were trying out.
Phoebe: Oh! Heres Joseph Francis!
Phoebe: So what?! That doesnt give you the right to ditch me!
Phoebe: I dont accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to showup. Okay, I cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better!Yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that theirfriendship) is for life!
Phoebe: Well, it does.
Phoebe: Okay, you wore me down.
Phoebe: (gasps) (whispering) Oh my God! Thats David!
Phoebe: David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who wentto Russia and broke my heart David!
Phoebe: Oh, you say someones name enough, they turn around.
Phoebe: David! (He kisses her cheek) What-what are you doing here? Arentyou supposed to be in Russia?
Phoebe: Well Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: Well, of course I would want to see you. II think about you allthe time.
Phoebe: Really?
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: (excited) Yes! Oh no! 
Phoebe: I cant. I cant believe I have plans, I cant. Can youdo it tomorrow night though?
Phoebe: Uh-huh. (They go over and talk.)
Phoebe: Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
Phoebe: No he wont. And thats not even the point! Monica, I made awhole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now yknow what? Justbecause, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-Ishould change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I dont have myprinciples, I dont have anything!
Phoebe: Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and watersfine.
Phoebe: Okay. 
Phoebe: Oh Joey, weve heard the specials three times! Okay? Theresprime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (She grabs his menu and hands itto the waiter.)
Phoebe: Huh?
Phoebe: (checking her watch) Yeah, Im very wise. I know.
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: God Joey, this is taking forever!
Phoebe: W-wI justits thatI haveyknow Ihave-I have an appointment. And its very important.
Phoebe: Well Its a date.
Phoebe: Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this.
Phoebe: ThatIts not the same thing! This is totallydifferent! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, hes veryspecial to me.
Phoebe: She was?
Phoebe: Okay, whatever. Yknow what? I dont have time have time toconvince you because hes only here for four hours, and Im gonna go see him!(Gets up and leaves.)
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Yeah! (She exits.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Oh, I wouldnt miss this.
Phoebe: Oh, youre such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! Weregoing to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)
Phoebe: Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk inlike
Phoebe: Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?
Phoebe: Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
Phoebe: Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it. 
Phoebe: I do too. (They kiss.)
Phoebe: (seeing him) Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yellat me tomorrow.
Phoebe: No Im not okay. The only guy Ive ever been crazy about hasgone to Minsk and I may neverI may never see him again. (Crying.)
Phoebe: Oh right, like theyre gonna let me have a passport.
Phoebe: WellButNow, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation ofsub-atomic particles yknow before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)
Phoebe: (looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isnt Mother Natureamazing?
Phoebe: Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, thatspretty amazing too.
Phoebe: Oh! I wont say, no to a movie!
Phoebe: Shh! Get me out of here.
Phoebe: (crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please dont be a spaceship. Please dont be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around andfinds that its the smoke detector thats beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves achair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration sheyanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she getsthere it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.)How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can
Phoebe: Dont interrupt me!!
Phoebe: Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here.(She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have todo (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets upand heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping hasstopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entranceto the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smokedetector.) (Yelling.) What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Phoebe: Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into thechute.) Noisy bitch!
Phoebe: Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Phoebe: (scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding theblanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?
Phoebe: Thats not mine.
Phoebe: How do you know?
Phoebe: Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the lasttime I checked this was still America!
Phoebe: Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop themfrom going off!
Phoebe: Theres a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits andshe goes to shut it off.) Theres a reset button! My God! Why didnt I see that!(She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button,where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.)Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached tothe detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh,God!
Phoebe: What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
Phoebe: I cant believe I still dont know what happened to the windowin the attic!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey.
Phoebe: Ugh, I hate this year!
Phoebe: Well okay, its already February and Ive only given twomassages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Phoebe: Oh thats right!
Phoebe: Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephonejob I had. Yknow, I probably wouldnt have to say spank as much. (Monica andRoss are shocked.) 
Phoebe: Oh yeah, like you never called!
Phoebe: Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Phoebe: Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from thescript.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supplymanager please?
Phoebe: Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Phoebe: Oh okay, well Im sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up thephone.) Yeah youre right, this is easy.
Phoebe: Oh well, all rightum, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Phoebe: (on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak toyour supply manager please? (Listens) Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe fromEmpire Office Supplies Id like to talk to you about your toner needs. (Shesreading from the script.)
Phoebe: Im hearing what youre saying, but at our prices everyoneneeds toner.
Phoebe: May I ask why?
Phoebe: I surely do!
Phoebe: (doesnt have any luck) Umm, is-is that because youre out oftoner?
Phoebe: No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk tome.
Phoebe: Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Phoebe: Chandler?
Phoebe: No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!
Phoebe: Earl, youre not hearing me! All Im saying is thatyoure not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of hercoworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didnt mean him.)
Phoebe: Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Phoebe: All right so Earl, lets just forget about the people at theoffice, okay? There-theres gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking aroundfor! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
Phoebe: Oh sorry, boyfriend!
Phoebe: No, whatever! Anything!
Phoebe: Yeah, hes gotta go.
Phoebe: No! Im not finished yet! Dont! Dont you dare hang upon me!!!
Phoebe: (to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? Hesthe supply manager around here.
Phoebe: (goes over to his desk) Earl! Im Phoebe.
Phoebe: Umm, look it, you-you cant kill yourself.
Phoebe: No-no I cant! I cant let you do it!
Phoebe: Because it was fate that made me call you today!
Phoebe: No! Think about it okay? This isnt even my regular job!Okay? And my first day on the job, youre my first call! And-and somebody elsemightve hung up on you, but I wouldnt do that because I know about this stuff.My mom killed herself.
Phoebe: Yes.
Phoebe: Im not gonna give you tips! Look dont you see thatthis-thisthis all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Phoebe: No, its fate!
Phoebe: Oh. Well umm, okay heres a weird thing. My mother was also asupply manager.
Phoebe: Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl,right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Phoebe: Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?
Phoebe: Oh my God! So was she! Oh, Ive got-Ive got goose bumps. (Sheholds out her arm.)
Phoebe: Well, yknow Im wearing layers and its warm.
Phoebe: But ifno look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but theuniverse does! And that says a lot!
Phoebe: Yknow, I dont-I dont think its you. This is afreaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no, its you.
Phoebe: Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Phoebe: Yeah, but you shouldnt compare yourself to me.
Phoebe: I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! Thats it!! Thatseverything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up withmy sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is aGodsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all headinto Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)
Phoebe: Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?
Phoebe: (getting out) Okay, whos next?
Phoebe: Really?! Cause yknow that hurts.
Phoebe: Least of all you.
Phoebe: (running up) Okay. Okay, heres what were gonna do. Okay,Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward soRoss can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She opens her coat andreveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel.She inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!!(Runs off.)
Phoebe: Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) Itsfor the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Phoebe: Because its our thirtieth birthday.
Phoebe: Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)
Phoebe: Yeah. What?!
Phoebe: Nu-uh!

Phoebe: Your middle name is Pamela?
Phoebe: Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Phoebe: Thats my first name.
Phoebe: Hey, whats going on?
Phoebe: Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Phoebe: Ohh! All right! All right. Heres what well do, Ill gettwice as drunk as Monica and then no ones will even notice her.
Phoebe: Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and youwanna have them for your brother.
Phoebe: If you could do that, Id marry the hippity-hop.
Phoebe: (clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Lets hear from thebirthday girl! Huh?
Phoebe: Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plansworking! I didnt even have to take off my top yet!
Phoebe: (screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!
Phoebe: (To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)
Phoebe: I lost a whole year! I cant believe it! This is so unfair!
Phoebe: Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were31?
Phoebe: Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! II havent done any ofthe things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Phoebe: Like okay I-I-I, I havent met any Portuguese people! I, Ihavent had the perfect kiss! And I havent been to snipers school!
Phoebe: No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? Illsee you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)
Phoebe: Oh yeah.
Phoebe: Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)
Phoebe: You did the right thing.
Phoebe: (Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Phoebe: Yeah? Why?
Phoebe: Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to anattractive man sitting at a table behind them.)
Phoebe: (A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help usfigure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)
Phoebe: Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Phoebe: Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Phoebe: Yeah That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They bothget up.)
Phoebe: I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Phoebe: That wasnt a date! That was, that was just friends gettingtogether(quietly) having sex.
Phoebe: No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Phoebe: Nice try.
Phoebe: I dont know. 
Phoebe: Ah-ha! Too cocky!
Phoebe: Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Phoebe: (handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but Id bet youdbe singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Phoebe: Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Phoebe: Did I use that already today? Im sorry.
Phoebe: Okay, a meat eater. Fine, thats one for you.
Phoebe: So you dont know thats Barneys the store! Thatcan be yknow his friends house, or a bar. Who has Barneys thestore on their speed dial?
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Good.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Ooh, now you lost me.
Phoebe: No I didnt!
Phoebe: No.
Phoebe: That is a different phone.
Phoebe: That is damning evidence.
Phoebe: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, Im the one who found your phone.
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Shhh! Im on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you canpick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. Its umm, its umm 5 MortonStreet, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe yknow after we can grab a bite to eat orwhatever. (Listens) Okay, well okay Ill see you then. (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up.)
Phoebe: Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Phoebe: Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would justbe aloneyknow to think about my mom and her suicide.
Phoebe: What?! Thats the first time today!
Phoebe: Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Phoebe: Because its my apartment!
Phoebe: Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all thecalls to China.
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Phoebe: Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Phoebe: Wh-what do we do?
Phoebe: Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting fora hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Phoebe: Hmm, they just dont make em like that anymore!
Phoebe: Rachel, listenI mean, if you let me have him then I will reallyowe you one.
Phoebe: Yeah! Youre such a great friend!
Phoebe: Oh thatd be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.
Phoebe: (whispering) Nice!
Phoebe: Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!! 
Phoebe: (returning with Joey) With what?
Phoebe: Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe: No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained onthe Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Phoebe: Yes! A friend of mine did it and its totally legal!
Phoebe: What?! No! It was my idea!
Phoebe: Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Phoebe: Oh my God, youve got to stop chattering!
Phoebe: What is it?
Phoebe: Oh no, I dont believe in Western medicine. No, if you just applypressure to these points right here. (Shes pinching the bit of skin between herright thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and youstill have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Its amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pillscalled?
Phoebe: Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with astory! (She pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)
Phoebe: Say what?
Phoebe: Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness,facial swelling, nausea, headacheHeadache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage!Now okay, I dont recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little deathcapsules! Oh Im sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Phoebe: Why?
Phoebe: I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)
Phoebe: Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Phoebe: I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?
Phoebe: Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!(Holds up the warning label.)
Phoebe: Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from theeyes?
Phoebe: Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
Phoebe: Yeah, its totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who youoriginally wanted to hook up with that night.
Phoebe: (To Joey) What?!
Phoebe: I know! Robin is so gay!
Phoebe: Im really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking whatwould happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up.
Phoebe: (still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checksher watch) Thats it! Im out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Phoebe: Oh, its like huge weight has been lifted! Cause look, (readsthe side affects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, Im just so happy! Because noshortness of breath, no temporary euphoriaOh.
Phoebe: Since when are you into swing music?
Phoebe: What is your job?
Phoebe: (wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
Phoebe: Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God!It doesnt matter; theyre both great!
Phoebe: Got it.
Phoebe: (coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Phoebe: (hearing the signal) Im coming! Im coming! (She takes offtowards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)
Phoebe: Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads theother way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction andfinds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of theway to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) Whatare you doing? (Rachel doesnt stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel wont stopso Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)
Phoebe: Did you find the dress?
Phoebe: IWe gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)
Phoebe: Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachels hand and drags her towards Monica.)Excuse me! Excuse me! (Shes knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.) 
Phoebe: I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: (gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?
Phoebe: Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Phoebe: Yeah, swing music is so out.
Phoebe: Yeah but the Swing Kings? Yknow they suck so much that peopleactually die at their concertsThey just stop living.
Phoebe: Oh my God! (Joey looks at her.) Im sorry, too soon. You go.
Phoebe: Good for you!
Phoebe: Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Phoebe: Go for it.
Phoebe: Im just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is inan accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover tosatisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Phoebe: I did, but that was really fun.
Phoebe: Oh hey!
Phoebe: Oh, great! We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night andthen every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair andtouch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)
Phoebe: (laughs) All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kissme? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Phoebe: Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickeyspeaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)
Phoebe: I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinkstoday and Ive only had six.
Phoebe: You sound like a guy.
Phoebe: Youll have a last kiss.
Phoebe: Okay bye. (They kiss.)
Phoebe: Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-byeat the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Phoebe: (yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)
Phoebe: No. Why?
Phoebe: Okay, dont sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowherearound so go ahead get it out of your system. That guys cute. (Points to a guysitting behind Monica.)
Phoebe: No that is the last thing you want to do!
Phoebe: Because youre marrying him!
Phoebe: All right, Ive never been engaged and Ive never really beenmarried, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fearsor anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Phoebe: That is correct! Yes, youre supposed to take all of that stuff andput it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Phoebe: Yes!
Phoebe: Oh my God! Youre right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tellChandler! Hurry before its too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also meanputting out doesnt get you love? (Monica is shocked.)
Phoebe: Rach? 
Phoebe: Oh. (Picks it up.) Its just so unexpected! II uhBoyIll tell you its just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prizeand yknow to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tonyaward for best actress in
Phoebe: in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. (To an imaginary NeilSimon) Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words. (Blows him a kiss.)
Phoebe: Please, dont play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEWYORK! ITS SATURDAY NIGHT!!
Phoebe: (To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?
Phoebe: What are you doing?
Phoebe: Oh! You got it?!
Phoebe: The next, next?
Phoebe: Whats the matter?
Phoebe: Grandmas gonna have to get in line.
Phoebe: Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Phoebe: Sure.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Well when can we have this shower?
Phoebe: Well thats only two days away. What is the other option?
Phoebe: Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! Were done!
Phoebe: Rachel, calm down!
Phoebe: (grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!
Phoebe: Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Phoebe: Uh, here. What time?
Phoebe: Finger sandwiches and tea.
Phoebe: And chili!
Phoebe: Both!
Phoebe: Neither.
Phoebe: Lusts of the flesh.
Phoebe: I dont know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?
Phoebe: Hey! Ive got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay,we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyones names in them and inside iseveryones individual birth stone.
Phoebe: Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know thats coming? Me. Are you?
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Okay but look! Look at what I got! Its her address book! (Holds itup.) We have a guest list!
Phoebe: Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple ofwomen.) Hi, thanks for coming.
Phoebe: Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes toanother pairing.) Oh, its so nice to see you.
Phoebe: Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?
Phoebe: Who the hell are all these people?
Phoebe: Hmm, yknow theres another word for people like that. Losers!
Phoebe: You were supposed to tell her!
Phoebe: Fine, Ill go call her.
Phoebe: And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
Phoebe: Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of peoplecame, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Phoebe: We ruined everything.
Phoebe: Sur-surprise.
Phoebe: Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Phoebe: Oh! No problem! I (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we onceagain visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flippingthing going on, only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on DeniseRichards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her officialwebsite at www.deniserichards.com.)
Phoebe: (in her head) Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! Shesnot your cousin!
Phoebe: I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joeys likein Checkers.) Chess!
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Phoebe: What is this? Whats going on?
Phoebe: Joeys!
Phoebe: (laughs) Yeah, Im sure that happened.
Phoebe: Sure!
Phoebe: (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on thecheek.
Phoebe: Okay! I justI didnt know that you are a lesbian. (Joeysmiles and nods lewdly.)
Phoebe: Okay, it just seems pretty wild and youre soyknowsovanilla.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: To Ross.
Phoebe: Okay! All right! Yeah! Cause I just cant picture it.
Phoebe: Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Phoebe: Yeah! Yknow, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut usdown when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Phoebe: Really?!
Phoebe: Oh, somewhere Joeys head is exploding.
Phoebe: Rachel, its okay. You dont have to do this. I believe you.All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Phoebe: I know.
Phoebe: I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Phoebe: Ive had better.
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)
Phoebe: Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)
Phoebe: Well maybe you dont talk about your feelings back then. Maybe youjust say something about yknow all the things that hes taught you. Like(They all try to think about one example and dont succeed.) Or all the things youtaught him.
Phoebe: Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Well lets just say its shes lucky she has a sweet ass,cause shes not so good at the writing.
Phoebe: Well lets just hope it works. Yknow nine out of tenmarriages end in divorce?
Phoebe: Yeah, youre right. Hows the Mrs.?
Phoebe: (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Startsyelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothesoff.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Phoebe: (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Phoebe: CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Phoebe: OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Phoebe: NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Phoebe: YOU KNOW?!!!
Phoebe: (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her andRachel.)
Phoebe: Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachelknows?
Phoebe: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of ourown
Phoebe: Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (Shepinches his butt.)
Phoebe: I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Phoebe: No!
Phoebe: God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess withus?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,you can't say anything!
Phoebe: He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Phoebe: Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didnt rip off any buttons.
Phoebe: Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and isshowcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.
Phoebe: You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
Phoebe: Ooh.
Phoebe: Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Phoebe: And why not?!
Phoebe: You're-you're what?!
Phoebe: I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were inlove!
Phoebe: Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gottachange things.
Phoebe: How could it not be? I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be havingkids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvodealership.
Phoebe: Hey.
Phoebe: Oh!
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: (To Monica) Oh, thats beautiful.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Ive never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive itall the time.
Phoebe: Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk aboutis the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)
Phoebe: Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Phoebe: Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)
Phoebe: Hey sweetie!
Phoebe: Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monicas. Ill be rightback. (She goes to get it.)
Phoebe: What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh.(Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: I know. They were mine.
Phoebe: No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to trythem on.
Phoebe: Im wearing his briefs right now.
Phoebe: I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Phoebe: And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actuallymore comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Phoebe: There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinkingeven more than you.
Phoebe: Im just saying that only a man completely secure with hismasculinity could walk around in womens underwear! I dont think you could everdo that.
Phoebe: Okay whatever.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: Huh.
Phoebe: Thats great Joe!
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: Hmm?
Phoebe: I think its important that you do.
Phoebe: Feel better?
Phoebe: Yeah, I understand.
Phoebe: Why?! Whats happening to the coffee house?! (Monica looks at her.)Oh! (Realizes.)
Phoebe: What are they?
Phoebe: That play?
Phoebe: The movie?
Phoebe: Ohh!
Phoebe: Oh, yeah! Back then yknow, we called the Great War. It really was!
Phoebe: Congratulations!
Phoebe: Go ahead.
Phoebe: Yes! Very good.
Phoebe: Ross, please! My make-up! (He walks away angrily.)
Phoebe: (walking up) Whats up? (Rachel hands her the note and she readsit.) Tell Monica Im sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!
Phoebe: Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Phoebe: Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed hisname, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry.
Phoebe: Dont be so negative! Good God! Isnt it possible that Sorryis sitting in there (Joey and Rachels apartment) right now?!
Phoebe: (pointing at Ross) Okay but if you dont find him and bringhim back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Phoebe: Oh man.
Phoebe: Okay. Well theres one down.
Phoebe: Yknow she might not even notice hes gone.
Phoebe: Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You cant do this here! (She dragsher into the bathroom.)
Phoebe: Yeah, but youve got to pull yourself together! Monica cantsee you like this! Then shell know somethings wrong!
Phoebe: Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, thats gone too. This is Monicasbathroom right?!
Phoebe: No-no! I-II found one.
Phoebe: (looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do youneed some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)
Phoebe: Oh heres a whole bunch.
Phoebe: (finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!
Phoebe: There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive.Monicas pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she wont be totallyalone.
Phoebe: I know! Monicas gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as hersomething new?
Phoebe: Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Phoebe: Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride ispregnant. The groom is missing. And Im still holding this. (She throws the test backinto the trash.)
Phoebe: Right.
Phoebe: Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she wasusing?
Phoebe: Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
Phoebe: You told them he was missing?
Phoebe: Okay. Im going with you.
Phoebe: Ross, youre tired. Youve been looking all night. And clearlyyou suck at this.
Phoebe: Okay. Wait, do you know how youre going to stall her?
Phoebe: All right. Good luck.
Phoebe: Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)
Phoebe: He could be in disguise, yknow.
Phoebe: What the hell are you doing?!
Phoebe: Why not?!
Phoebe: But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than Ido. But I totally believe you can do this.
Phoebe: (entering) Found the vest! I mean were gonna have to keep an eyeon it, yknow make sure we dont lose it again
Phoebe: So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Phoebe: Oh my God Monica!
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Wait! Maybe, maybe youre overreacting! You do thatyknow.
Phoebe: Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because, theyfrown on that.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Whats going on?
Phoebe: Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is aflight risk?!
Phoebe: Hey! Oh!
Phoebe: You know?!
Phoebe: What? Youll hi-ya?
Phoebe: Well you obviously didnt see Chucky 3.
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Oh and theyre gonna have a baby.
Phoebe: So, we realize thatOh no (She resets herself) Imtelling it! Im telling it (She loses it.)
Phoebe: Xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay[Beep]uck it!
Phoebe: Oh-ooh, and I brought Operation, but umm I lost the umm (Itstarts buzzing) Its making a noise.
Phoebe: Ooh, Soap Opera Digest!
Phoebe: Well at Monicas you can eat(Suddenly cracks up.)
Phoebe: What do I smell?
Phoebe: What do I smell?
Phoebe: What do I smell?
Phoebe: What do I smell?
Phoebe: (spitting the cookie out onto a napkin) Oh, sweetJe(Beep)sus! Oh! Monica, these are the (laughing) cookies they serve in hell!
Phoebe: Thank you my babies. (Waves good-bye.)
Phoebe: Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) HeyMon, why did you tell the guys you werent pregnant?
Phoebe: We found your test in the trash, if youre not pregnant(Shesees Rachel shaking her head)Its because I am.
Phoebe: Yes, II am with child. (Flash) And I didnt want to sayanything because its your day; I didnt want to steal your thunder.
Phoebe: I cant say.
Phoebe: I cant say because hes famous.
Phoebe: Okay, okay. Its James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of mybaby.
Phoebe: What?! Well he never said that to me!
Phoebe: How about just the bridemaids?
Phoebe: It is.
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Phoebe: So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
Phoebe: Sneaky.
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Phoebe: Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. andthen I remembered hes gay.
Phoebe: (intrigued) Really?!
Phoebe: So, are you ready to talk about it?
Phoebe: Now?
Phoebe: Okay, well talk about something else then.
Phoebe: Whos the father?!
Phoebe: Yeah. Thats fine. Thats fair. Is it Tag?
Phoebe: Okay, Im sorry. Ill stop.
Phoebe: Is it Ross? Its Ross isnt itOh my God, its Joey!
Phoebe: Ah-hah! At least we know its a him.
Phoebe: Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin
Phoebe: Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he wouldleave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolinsaid
Phoebe: (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?
Phoebe: Calm down. Maybe youre not pregnant.
Phoebe: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three timesjust to make sure.
Phoebe: Im-Im just saying, dont freak out until youre ahundred percent sure.
Phoebe: Ill run out and get you one.
Phoebe: Oh no, she wont tell us.
Phoebe: See? This is why you register.
Phoebe: 30 seconds.
Phoebe: Its time.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Umm, its negative.
Phoebe: Its negative.
Phoebe: Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)
Phoebe: No, its positive.
Phoebe: Its-its not negative, its positive.
Phoebe: Well yeah, I lied before.
Phoebe: Now you know how you really feel about it.
Phoebe: With who?
Phoebe: Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
Phoebe: A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an oldwoman.
Phoebe: Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
Phoebe: Oh yeah.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Well I guess its okay to open one more if its part of a set.Yknow, its probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)
Phoebe: Yeah thats right Chandler does still think Im pregnant. Hehasnt asked me how Im feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad forthe woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.
Phoebe: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the firstfloor?
Phoebe: What?! I think hes cute.
Phoebe: Believe me Im trying.
Phoebe: Yeah. Youre just gonna knock on his door and change his lifeforever. Youre like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexualmagnetism.
Phoebe: Pretty big? Its huge! God, this guy doesnt have a clue!Hes just walking down the street thinking, I had sex with Rachel Green. Irock! then bam! Hes a father and everythings different.
Phoebe: Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now heswalking around thinking, Do I want to be a dad? and then bam!
Phoebe: I dont. He gothe-he-he-hes hit by a bus.
Phoebe: Oh yeah. Thats me.
Phoebe: Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, Im gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebehug.)
Phoebe: You dont know him. Its not important. He wants nothing to dowith me or the baby. (She sits down like shes pregnant.)
Phoebe: David Lynn.
Phoebe: Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
Phoebe: Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
Phoebe: Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? (Gasps) Is itGunther?
Phoebe: Thank God, cause that hair on a baby
Phoebe: Why not?
Phoebe: Bus?
Phoebe: Well-well but it is huge.
Phoebe: Youre thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get itover with. Its like, its like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quickand painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother ofSee?
Phoebe: (entering) Hey.
Phoebe: All right. (She sits down like shes pregnant again.)
Phoebe: Hell yeah! Ill marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)
Phoebe: Hey lady, your days over! Its my turn!
Phoebe: I can and I will! (Kisses him.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Its Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths I loveyou to him.)
Phoebe: We dont know.
Phoebe: Who? Who is it?
Phoebe: Was that story over? 
Phoebe: (gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is (She walks into Monicaand Chandlers.)
Phoebe: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I calledthe father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
Phoebe: I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a prettyblond girl with an ass that wont quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) Ibelieve this belongs to the father of your baby.
Phoebe: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip theBand-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Phoebe: Really? Are you sure?
Phoebe: Okay, sorry. Yeah. (They go inside to confront the father.)
Phoebe: Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe thatthis is your red sweater.
Phoebe: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me?Okay. (Walks away.)
Phoebe: What?!!
Phoebe: No!!
Phoebe: I cant say that didnt hurt. But Ill take you back JoeyTribbiani.
Phoebe: Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
Phoebe: Wait you stole those from these peoples wedding?
Monica and Phoebe: Oh my God!!
Phoebe: Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
Phoebe: It was his sweater, butOh my God!
Phoebe: Me too! (Joins the hug.)
Phoebe: Yeah, bye.
Phoebe: Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
Phoebe: All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitarin their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
Phoebe: What?! They took mine to give to you!
Phoebe: Maybe they dont trust us.
Phoebe: You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up withMonicas guest towels?
Phoebe: No you didnt.
Phoebe: Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
Phoebe: What stuff?
Phoebe: Did Rachel find you?
Phoebe: Oh she was looking for you.
Phoebe: Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: (deadpan) And?
Phoebe: Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!
Phoebe: (To Joey) Maybe its something you ate?
Phoebe: Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon astheyre done with it at the key shining place.
Phoebe: Well why dont you use your key?
Phoebe: Oh! We could have done that.
Phoebe: Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler andMonica about this? Cause yknow umm, they dont-they dont have anykids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
Phoebe: Oh no.
Phoebe: Didnt you two already talk?
Phoebe: (simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!
Phoebe: That is brand new information!!
Phoebe: A little bit.
Phoebe: Oh Ross.
Phoebe: Oh hey hi, hes doing it. Hes breaking down the door. (Thechair breaks in half.) Okay, were in. (She hangs up the phone.)
Phoebe: Hey! So how was the doctor?
Phoebe: Good.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Come on in! 
Phoebe: So how was the honeymoon?
Phoebe: That was the best part? (To Chandler) Good honeymooning tiger.
Phoebe: Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! (Angrily) Hi Greg, Im Chandler this isMonica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
Phoebe: You have got to be kidding me!
Phoebe: Monica! Thats not right! Start with where.
Phoebe: I cant believe he taped the two of them having sex!
Phoebe: (nasally) Greg and Jenny?
Phoebe: You got fake numbered.
Phoebe: Excuse me, I dont want Greg and Jennys rejects.
Phoebe: Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
Phoebe: Thats like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise yourright hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
Phoebe: Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)
Phoebe: No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
Phoebe: Okay fine! Fine! Well just have to think of some other way to putthe whole Who came onto who, thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
Phoebe: Youre gonna get pregnant.
Phoebe: Oh, you came on to Ross!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Dinner was good! 
Phoebe: Im just saying hi! Now Im gonna go! 
Phoebe: (To him) Oh, well hello there.
Phoebe: (To Monica) I didnt see this on the menu.
Phoebe: Oh, so you're Monicas boss?
Phoebe: Oh! I sous stand.
Phoebe: Oh youyou made pesto?
Phoebe: Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
Phoebe: I made it myself.
Phoebe: Well, its no pesto.
Phoebe: Ooh Monica!
Phoebe: Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is sosweet! Oh, I cant wait to get sous-neath him.
Phoebe: But why?!
Phoebe: Well maybe he was just nervous, yknow you can be veryintimidating. And besides Ive met your pastry chef and she can stand to be takendown a peg or two.
Phoebe: But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him anotherchance? Please?
Phoebe: Thats fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when hegot the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
Phoebe: Love it!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: But
Phoebe: Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.
Phoebe: Because Im dumping him today.
Phoebe: He is sweet. Hes too sweet. He calls me all the time.(Mimicking him) "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you getout of the shower okay?"
Phoebe: Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) "Im so worried aboutyou." Uck! Be a man!
Phoebe: You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell killhimself.
Phoebe: Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill myself!
Phoebe: Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoevergoes second is the bitch.
Phoebe: Come on! The boss that fires a guy thats just been dumped, bitch!And the woman who dumps a guy thats just been fired, blond bitch!
Phoebe: All right, that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh.ButScrew you Im going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)
Phoebe: Hi.
Phoebe: It will bein a minute. Listen, Tim youre a really great guy.
Phoebe: Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) ImjustIm in a place in my life right now where II
Phoebe: Oh-oh no she doesnt! I know what that is. You can stay.
Phoebe: Monica!
Phoebe: (simultaneously) Im breaking up with you!
Phoebe: Im, Im breaking up with you.
Phoebe: Im sorry, Im justImIm just not readyfor a relationship right now.
Phoebe: Oh thats good, the chemistry thing for us too.
Phoebe: And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves,which disgusts Monica.)
Phoebe: Oh good! (And theres general excitement.)
Phoebe: Now wasnt Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
Phoebe: Ursula! (Ursula turns, smiles, and continues walking.) Wait! Err-err,its me! Phoebe!
Phoebe: Wait a second! So, whats new with you?
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Huh. Okay. Well, Im really happy for you. (Starts to walk away.)
Phoebe: Really?
Phoebe: Yeah. Okay. Umm, yknow, my friends are having a Halloween partytonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy youremarrying.
Phoebe: By the way, its a costume party.

Phoebe: Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
Phoebe: No, its me. Phoebe!

Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: My mother killed herself.
Phoebe: No-no! Thats okay, well just start over. Okay? Hi! ImPhoebe.
Phoebe: Why are you looking at me like that?
Phoebe: Okay. (Hands him a napkin.) So, what are you?
Phoebe: (laughs) No I-I meant your costume.
Phoebe: I love the second grade!
Phoebe: Yeah! Its so much better than first grade when you dont knowwhats going on and definitely better than third grade. Yknow with allthe politics and mind games.
Phoebe: Umm, Im a masseuseby day. (Stands with her hands on her hipslike a Supergirl pose.)
Phoebe: No Im having fun. Im reallyAnd Im really-reallyexcited for you and Ursula.
Phoebe: Thank you.
Phoebe: (walking over) Hey. Ursulas fiancée is really sweet!Hes a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Yknow normally yknow, Idont like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: No Im not! You are!
Phoebe: Hello handsome. (Sees Ursula over her shoulder) Oh God. (Walks away inshame as they kiss.) Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
Phoebe: Two weeks? Thats it?
Phoebe: Oh really?
Phoebe: Huh? (Ursula motions for Phoebe to keep quiet.)
Phoebe: Peace Corps, really? (Ursula motions, "I dont know.")
Phoebe: Hi liar!
Phoebe: Yknow the only reason hes marrying you is because he thinksall the things you were saying about yourself were true.
Phoebe: But theyre not!
Phoebe: Why are you lying to him?
Phoebe: You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
Phoebe: Hmm?
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
Phoebe: Umm listen, I dont thinkI dont think Im gonnamake it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
Phoebe: Okay I cant let you do this! Shes lying to you.
Phoebe: She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabsUrsulas purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay.YeahNot a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.(Holds up her nametag.) Okay, heres the nametag from the restaurant where she worksas a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, heres her driver license, thisoughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
Phoebe: Oh, I almost dont want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Justremember Im a minute younger.
Phoebe: No. Youre not, youre not stupid.
Phoebe: Thats good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic.Justyou did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?
Phoebe: Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)
Phoebe: (looking around) Whos cell phone is that? Its just soannoying; everywhere you go.
Phoebe: (checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?
Phoebe: Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, howd you get this number?
Phoebe: Wow! What an incredible violationand wonderful surprise.
Phoebe: Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!
Phoebe: Shhh! Im talking.
Phoebe: Are you asking me out? Cause it would be kinda weird since youjust broke up with my sister.
Phoebe: No! Wait! I was just saying that so youd think I was a goodperson. Fight for me.
Phoebe: Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at yourapartment in two hours.
Phoebe: Ive got friends too. Okay, bye.
Phoebe: Oh my God! Im going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonnabe so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I cant make lunch.(Exits.)

Phoebe: Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.
Phoebe: Maybe this is too weird.
Phoebe: No dont tear out your eyes!!
Phoebe: Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?
Phoebe: Look Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but itshouldnt be this hard. Yknow? This is our first date yknow? Firstdates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and Ooh, he just touchedmy hand, did he mean to touch my hand? and yknow first kisses and(Hekisses her)second kisses. (Motions for him to kiss her again which he does and theystart to make out.)
Phoebe: Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.

Phoebe: You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!
Phoebe: You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!
Phoebe: Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
Phoebe: So I guess this is it.
Phoebe: Yeah, so do you.
Phoebe: Huh?
Phoebe: Sure. Yeah, hes kinda sexy.
Phoebe: Okay so, well just come up with some kind of signal if itsgoing well you can take off.
Phoebe: Oh. Why not?
Phoebe: Oh Rachel, this is all so Papa dont preach.
Phoebe: Wow! Oh well, I will be there! 
Phoebe: Gosh. Im not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. (They bothsit down by the rest of the gang and Phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) Oh. Hey! Whois that guy? I think I know him.
Phoebe: Oh my God!!! Monica!! Hes the stripper from your bacheloretteparty!!
Phoebe: Your secret bachelorette party
Phoebe: She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!
Phoebe: Oh, I-I dont eat meat.
Phoebe: Yeah, I dont eat that either.
Phoebe: Hes right though, the 74 is absolute piss.
Phoebe: Rachel!
Phoebe: Why, so he can get mad at the baby?
Phoebe: Its slang for pregnant.
Phoebe: Im sorry I wont be able to make it to your imaginarywedding, but Im really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptismand a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
Phoebe: Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
Phoebe: Id better go. (She goes and sits down in the La-Z-Boy E-cliner3000, the chair that Sit magazine called chair of the year, and they both look ather.) Just over here: I dont want to miss the fight.
Phoebe: Thats it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on abreak!" "No we werent!" What happened to you two?!
Phoebe: (entering, quietly) Wow, you told your dad the truth.

Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)
Phoebe: Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows?(Theres a stretchy part in front.) And then after the babys born, theyregreat for shoplifting melons.
Phoebe: Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Happy Thanksgiving!
Phoebe: Anything I can do to help?
Phoebe: Sure!
Phoebe: Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)
Phoebe: Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (ToChandler) So hows the game?
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: I dont believe you! That isbrilliant! And Monica has noidea?
Phoebe: Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I dont think I can helpyou after all, I didnt realize this game was on.
Phoebe: Well normally I dont, but yknow(looks at theTV)Green Bay is playing.
Phoebe: Well its only like my favorite bay! {Actually, its not bad.It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August toJune. J }

Phoebe: Oh okay.
Phoebe: Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
Phoebe: Yeah.

Phoebe: I think you do.
Phoebe: What?! What else did you do?
Phoebe: Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
Phoebe: Oh! (They all look.) Wow!
Phoebe: So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early birddinner?
Phoebe: I wanna join!
Phoebe: Im sorry. Im sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-Ididnt go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learnFrench. Bonjour.
Phoebe: Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) Its exactly how Id imaginedit would be.
Phoebe: Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Phoebe: Is there anything we can do for you?
Phoebe: How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
Phoebe: Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait tohear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick."
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Hey Ross! Doesnt Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
Phoebe: Sting has a son that goes there too!
Phoebe: You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaurstuff you tell us?!
Phoebe: Stings son, seven years old and theres a picture.
Phoebe: No, its New York magazine. Its an article about thebest schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
Phoebe: Uh-huh, yeah thats too bad. I really want to go to his concertFriday night, but its totally sold out. I know! Why dont you meet him and gettickets?! If you get two Ill take you.
Phoebe: There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Stingtomorrow! Thats why you have kids!
Phoebe: Wow! Theyre beautiful!
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Well then get your money back and return them!
Phoebe: Oh no! Why not?
Phoebe: How come?!
Phoebe: Wait! But Ross if they dont get along then you shouldsmooth things over. Make them be friends.

Phoebe: (singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me thetickets!!
Phoebe: Oh, there you are Ben!
Phoebe: Well, I heard youre having a problem with one of the boys in yourclass. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a littletalk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boys name is Stings son.
Phoebe: Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but theyhave famous fathers.
Phoebe: Him youre friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying tofind Jack and a teacher notices her.)
Phoebe: Yes! Yes you can, Im looking for Jacks parents.
Phoebe: Uh-huh, Im with Ben.
Phoebe: I am one of Bens mothers. Im a lesbian. It was, it wasdifficult coming out to my parents.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
Phoebe: Yeah! Lets do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down andtalk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
Phoebe: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? Cause Carolthrew it out, she lost ours. Shes such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece ofass.
Phoebe: Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Stings penthat hegave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase)Come on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.)
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: Why else would I be here?
Phoebe: Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.)
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Umm, Im sorry. Wont-wont Jacks father be joiningus?
Phoebe: Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday nightperhaps at 8 oclock?
Phoebe: Concert. Yeah. That does put us inquite a pickle. Because you seeIm very busy before and after the concert, and hes obviously busy during.
Phoebe: Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm,all the while thinking about the children of course.
Phoebe: Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
Phoebe: Oh good! Then youre in luck! Bens not my son!
Phoebe: The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)
Phoebe: Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Phoebe: Oo, where are the seats?
Phoebe: Okay, now would you say that thats more than 50 yards away fromSting, his wife, or a member of his family?
Phoebe: Then thats not breaking the law! Im there!
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And tobe completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
Phoebe: Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Phoebe: This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones startgoing crazy.
Phoebe: Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets soin, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
Phoebe: Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of EvanderHolyfield from a Foot Locker.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Yeah. Yeah, thats what you need a goodpill.
Phoebe: (sitting down next to Ross) Yknow she has a face Ross!
Phoebe: Bye.
Phoebe: Wait, Im-Im sorry. Whats the big deal about a holidaycard?
Phoebe: Oh hey! So, how did your doctors appointment go?
Phoebe: Oh my God.
Phoebe: Okay, remember that little problem I was having during myfourth month ofpregnancy?
Phoebe: You wish.
Phoebe: Oh yeah? Come and get it.
Phoebe: Ugh! Women!
Phoebe: Give her a key to your apartment.
Phoebe: No, we hate that.
Phoebe: (entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! Howd the conversation go?
Phoebe: Where?! (Ross exits.)
Phoebe: Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
Phoebe: So umm, Im gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help meout?
Phoebe: Umm, hes here to have sex with you.
Phoebe: Youre welcome.
Phoebe: Its okay, hes a virgin.
Phoebe: Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.
Phoebe: Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!(Phoebe exits.)
Phoebe: Hi. Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It reallywasnt right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you somethingthat I think youll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying theEvander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? Im gonna, Im gonnawant him back. So (Looks at him longingly) Im gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause)(Entering) Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant! (She grabs the cutoutand exits for good.)
Phoebe: Hey! I got you a present!!
Phoebe: I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally gothere!
Phoebe: Its a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
Phoebe: I didnt know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
Phoebe: Do you really like it?
Phoebe: Oh really? What was your first?
Phoebe: No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked offall of your top scores, how sad.
Phoebe: Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
Phoebe: Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you,then maybe I should just keep it.
Phoebe: Yeah! Its not like it spits out a Clark bar after everygame.
Phoebe: (entering) Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging thegame before(Sees the top ten list)Oh my God! Your friends have someunfortunate initials!
Phoebe: Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
Phoebe: I know!
Phoebe: Dont touch me!!
Phoebe: I cant!! I cant!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of abitch!!!!! 
Phoebe: Oh hi BenNo!! Dont look at the machine! (Covers the screen.)
Phoebe: Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
Phoebe: Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinkingof names yet?
Phoebe: Me too!
Phoebe: Uh huh! If its a girl, Phoebe, and if its a boy, Phoebo!
Phoebe: Yeah, by Sandrine.
Phoebe: How-how about you each get five vetoes?
Phoebe: I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
Phoebe: Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
Phoebe: (from outside the bathroom) You guys?
Phoebe: Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Fine.
Phoebe: Then its really too bad that you cant tell me.
Phoebe: (Groans) Is it Chandler?
Phoebe: Well, then tell him to stop staring!
Phoebe: Really?! Joey?! You dont say.
Phoebe: I dont know, I dont know, I dont know. You know, I mean,on the one hand, Mother may I? But yknow on the other hand No. No, Icant. Were friends. No, oh, no. I dont want to risk what we have.
Phoebe: Sure, yeah. I mean, its Joey. I dont want him to get hurt.Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
Phoebe: Sure.
Phoebe: Hey.
Phoebe: Umm, Joey, I know.
Phoebe: I knooow.
Phoebe: I know about your feelings.
Phoebe: Yes, and Im sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler andMonica, but thats very rare.
Phoebe: For God sakes, its Rachel!
Phoebe: Yeah thats Rachel. (To herself) Beat me over the head with it.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Joey, I just think youre getting worked up over nothing. This isprobably just a crush.
Phoebe: Absolutely! Yknow, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goesaway.
Phoebe: Thats right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I knowIve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And Im sureyouve had them for us.
Phoebe: Mm-hmm. (To herself) Throw me a bone here.
Phoebe: Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you knowhow it went with Joey.
Phoebe: Well, you were wrong, he doesnt like me!
Phoebe: Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors house andtold you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didntlike you? How would you feel?
Phoebe: Really? Lee Majors is hot!
Phoebe: Were in the bathroom!
Phoebe: (checking for herself) (To Monica) Mazel tov.

Phoebe: So do you want to hang out or something?
Phoebe: Oh are you and Chandler
Phoebe: Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
Phoebe: You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
Phoebe: Oh my God! Youre getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!

Phoebe: I cant believe this! How long as this been going on?
Phoebe: Oh, it has a name?
Phoebe: OkayOop! Too late! Im leaving! Come on Chandler letsgo! (She storms out.)

Phoebe: Im curious about the human body.
Phoebe: But Im a professional! And Im really good! Look, ifyoure uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
Phoebe: It does! How would you feel if you couldnt share your cooking?Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldnt teach us about dragons.
Phoebe: Potato, potaato. 
Phoebe: (calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?
Phoebe: (in a soothing voice) Great, lets begin. (She starts the massage.)Hows the pressure?
Phoebe: Stating the obvious, but thank you. And its not weird is it.

Phoebe: Hey.
Phoebe: No-no, I got that.
Phoebe: Okay. Okay but you should know though, Ive raised my rates to $200an hour.
Phoebe: I mean $500.
Phoebe: 600.
Phoebe: Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
Phoebe: Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried tohurt you and it just spurred you on.
Phoebe: Really? Theres nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God!Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?!(Pause) I mean hi.
Phoebe: No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages! No look, Ihave, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
Phoebe: Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again.Come back and-and well work through it.
Phoebe: Yes.
Phoebe: Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did youhear something you liked?

Phoebe: Yeah, you like that dont you?
Phoebe: You want it there? You take it there baby!

Phoebe: Oh, Monica, grow up!
Phoebe: (knocking and entering) Hey. Look, I know youve been really depressedlately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real,live, furry playmate.
Phoebe: He-hee!

Phoebe: How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
Phoebe: Taffy, really? Ive never had any.
Phoebe: Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to providesaltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what, youre just never going totell her?
Phoebe: If I havent said it before: shes a lucky, lucky lady! So, whereare you going towhat the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (Referring to thetaffy, which shes been chewing this whole time.) Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food?Whats the deal? (she swallows it, finally) Oh, its nice! May I try a pink one?
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Hey, buddy. Hows my favorite dog, huh? Hows my favorite dog?(the dog doesnt move) Youre subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?
Phoebe: Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
Phoebe: Hes miserable! What happened to him?
Phoebe: What stuff?
Phoebe: OhJoey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world,and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
Phoebe: Okay, Im going to take him back to Wendys.
Phoebe: (entering) Oh hey you guys!
Phoebe: Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
Phoebe: Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?
Phoebe: Okay, good.
Phoebe: Well last night, I met Monicas.
Phoebe: Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her otherhalf.
Phoebe: Well hes tall.
Phoebe: He has brown hair.
Phoebe: He works with food!
Phoebe: Obviously, and hes British.
Phoebe: Yeah? And, hes-hes so centered and mature and confident.
Phoebe: Oh, Im so sorry. Um, and maybe Im wrong! Ibutyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.
Phoebe: Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.
Phoebe: Oh! Hi!
Phoebe: Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Phoebe: (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.
Phoebe: (cough talks) Soul mate.
Phoebe: Nothing! I swear to God I didnt know you guys would be here! Andthe good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. So
Phoebe: Theyre just talking, and yknow what? Just because I thinktheyre soul mates doesnt mean anythings gonna happen.
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Dont worry, well find you someone else.
Phoebe: Im so sorry.
Phoebe: I dont know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! Idont know how you fight that.
Phoebe: Okay, so when youre done with your tea Ill look at yourleaves and tell you your fortune.
Phoebe: Oh yeah, Ive done it for years. I actually stopped because I wasso accurate. Yknow, and-and yknow, one of the great joys of life isits-its wondrous unpredictability. Yknow? And also tea tends to give methe trots.
Phoebe: Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book)Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
Phoebe: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, whos next?
Phoebe: Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
Phoebe: Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean youre having a babyor youre gonna make a scientific discovery!
Phoebe: Umm Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, Imgonna meet a guy! And really soon! And hes gonna be the man of my dreams. Probablynot the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)
Phoebe: (noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait asecond you guysfor the last couple weeks Ive been that guy everywhere I go. Wetake the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe hes thetea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)
Phoebe: Oh hello.
Phoebe: Oh Jim, Jim Nelson Im Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly havebeen seeing a lot of each other lately. 
Phoebe: Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around andthe exchange information.)
Phoebe: Isnt it funny how we kept running into each other? Its as ifsomeone really wants us to be together.
Phoebe: Oh, witty banter. Well done.
Phoebe: Oh okay, well Im a masseuse, and I used to work at thisplace
Phoebe: I-I-I like, I like parties.
Phoebe: Yeah I guess, a little.
Phoebe: (a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someonewildly I guess, for ummWell since I was fourteen.
Phoebe: Oh stop it.
Phoebe: Okay. Umm look, youre coming on a little strong. But Imgoing to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants tobe together. So, why dont we just start over okay? And you can just tell me aboutyourself.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Wow! You do?
Phoebe: All right. (Gets up and walks out.)
Phoebe: Oh there it is.
Phoebe: I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so Ihave to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adultbookstore, a new grocery store
Phoebe: A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guyand thats what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there Im going to kicksome ass.
Phoebe: Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
Phoebe: Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going todo?
Phoebe: A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Nowyoure talking.
Phoebe: I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.
Phoebe: (looking around) She mustve left.
Phoebe: Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parentsanniversary party?
Phoebe: Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
Phoebe: Yeah, hes really great though. He has this incredible zest forlife, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughtygirl I am.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Ill go with you
Phoebe: Were you guys making fun of Parker?
Phoebe: So, he a little enthusiastic, whats wrong with that?
Phoebe: Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people youve dated?Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends dont do that. But, do you want my opinion? Doyou want it? Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like thewhos who of human crap. (Walks off)
Phoebe: No, Im fine. Im great. Im with you.
Phoebe: Hm huh, yeah.
Phoebe: No, thats not necessary.
Phoebe: No, actually I dont eat
Phoebe: Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it whiledropping it on the floor) Mmmhmmmmm.
Phoebe: Why dont you just try one?
Phoebe: Then you better do it now.
Phoebe: Because Im going to kill him
Phoebe: You guys were right. Hes just too excited abouteverything. Imean Im all for living life, but this is the Gellers 35thanniversary. Okay? Lets call a spade a spade this party stinks.
Phoebe: Are you sure it wasnt an oyster?
Phoebe: Hes just such a great guy Im so excited about him.
Phoebe: You think?
Phoebe: Youre right. Youre right, hes just embracing life. Wecould all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! Im asunny, positive person. 
Phoebe: Whats that now?
Phoebe: Oh look its Parker! 
Phoebe: Oooh I love it!
Phoebe: Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
Phoebe: Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium? 
Phoebe: Oh thank God. 
Phoebe: Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why dont we just um, sit andrelax? You know just be with each other. Quietly! 
Phoebe: Lets try something else, lets play a game.
Phoebe: Shocking! Lets play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.(Giggles)
Phoebe: But, lets play this one first. And remember whoever talks firstloses! 
Phoebe: Oh my God! Oh my God! 
Phoebe: Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isnt perfect?Everything isnt magical? Everything isnt a glow with the light of a millionfairies? They were just brake lights, Parker! 
Phoebe: You dont have to put a good spin on everything.
Phoebe: No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland,getting laid! 
Phoebe: Much less happy!
Phoebe: So long! Dont let the best door in the world hit you in the ass onyour way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)
Phoebe: Uh huh. (Closes door)
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)
Phoebe: Im gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?
Phoebe: (interrupting him) I was just being polite!
Phoebe: Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding hisbreath for almost four minutes! 
Phoebe: Umm, II just think you dont expect someone so hot to be sosweet.
Phoebe: Umm, Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe: Oh okay, its P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as inebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in (In an Australian accent) Ello there mate!
Phoebe: Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Phoebe: Ohhh.
Phoebe: (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that'sjust an old Wonton!
Phoebe: Ohh, tough call.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Phoebe: Oh, please!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do. 
Phoebe: Well I dont, I dont have a mother so often I forget thatother people
Phoebe: No. (Pause) Neither is mine.
Phoebe: I know. I know, whats her number?
Phoebe: Isnt it at three?
Phoebe: Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Thats good right?
Phoebe: What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hiMrs. Green!
Phoebe: Im so glad you could make it.
Phoebe: Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make smalltalk with.
Phoebe: No look, weve apologized twice! I cant do anymore than that.I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
Phoebe: For how long?
Phoebe: She cant hear you.
Phoebe: Well, if you dont want your mother to move in with you, just tellher.
Phoebe: I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! Its time toopen the presents!
Phoebe: How about you less important people, lets open your presents!
Phoebe: Okay, come on Rach its present time! Yknow youre theglue thats holding this whole party together. Its kinda falling apart here.
Phoebe: Okay, this is from your friend at work.
Phoebe: Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
Phoebe: Not if you were here.
Phoebe: No, not a thing.
Phoebe: Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and shesbeen nothing but terrible to you. And dont forget you just threw her daughtera lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasnt even thanked you forit.
Phoebe: Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, Id tell her off.
Phoebe: Uh-huh!
Phoebe: (To Monica) Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up
Phoebe: You were fantastic! Im so proud of you!
Phoebe: You should be!
Phoebe: You got it!
Phoebe: Well thats no way to sell newspapers. Why dont you try,"Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
Phoebe: Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Well did she know you two werent married?
Phoebe: Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man,we-we must alert the church elders!
Phoebe: Sounds like youre a little jealous.
Phoebe: Is that a real place? (Rachels stunned) Are they hiring?
Phoebe: Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
Phoebe: Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
Phoebe: Yeah, just dont get your hopes up.
Phoebe: Well, the interview
Phoebe: Yknow! You dont make a very good first impression.
Phoebe: Oh you dont know.
Phoebe: Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah."I was like, shhh!
Phoebe: Well its just like youre trying too hard. Always makingjokes, yknow, you justYou come off a little needy.
Phoebe: Oh! Its okay, you calm down after a while and then people can seehow really sweet and wonderful you really are.
Phoebe: All right, dont freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. Howlong before you have to leave?
Phoebe: I cant help you.
Phoebe: All right, all right, well just do our best. Okay? So letssay Im the interviewer and Im meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi!Come on in, Im uh, Regina Philange."
Phoebe: Bing, what an unusual name.
Phoebe: Um-hmm, thats good to know. But lets stop focusing on whatyou dont do, and start focusing on what you do do.
Phoebe: I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Phoebe: You gotta go!
Phoebe: Okay, dont worry. Youre ready.
Phoebe: Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and youll begreat.
Phoebe: I started that!
Phoebe: Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end
Phoebe: Or you can do volunteer work.
Phoebe: Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart.What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.
Phoebe: (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster)Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-PhoebeBurrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor goingoff.)
Phoebe: Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
Phoebe: When she comes out, you hold her nose, Ill blow in her mouth, andthe kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.
Phoebe: I dont know. I-I think its still gonna be a while.
Phoebe: Youre on!
Phoebe: One hundred thousand dollars!
Phoebe: Fine! Ill call Zurich and move some money around.
Phoebe: No ones here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!
Phoebe: Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, youre still pregnant. Oh, Imsorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Yknow what? You look great. Yeah, likefifty bucks.
Phoebe: Its interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
Phoebe: Fine! Youre on!
Phoebe: Until then, General Grant, why dont you set up camp (She puts thebill in her bra) right there.
Phoebe: Good God man dont anger it.
Phoebe: Oh I-I dont know about that. No, I think that if the two of youhad sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. 
Phoebe: Thank you!
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Is Rachel having the baby?
Phoebe: Theyre at the coffeehouse.
Phoebe: We know its a girl! (Exits.)
Phoebe: Oh you made it!
Phoebe: (looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, themiracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
Phoebe: Sure! What?
Phoebe: Oh, this is fun.
Phoebe: Yeah. (Pause) Why arent you with Rachel?
Phoebe: But yknow what? It just seems that you two belong together.
Phoebe: Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)
Phoebe: I know!
Phoebe: Oh, it ate your money?
Phoebe: All right, Ill see you downstairs then.
Phoebe: All right.
Phoebe: Hi.
Phoebe: Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but cant.) I-Ihate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)
Phoebe: Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Phoebe: Well, its a long story. Its kind of embarrassing. Letsjust say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How aboutyou?
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Uh-huh, yeah.
Phoebe: Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
Phoebe: Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Phoebe: (to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patientIm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, hes likeearly to mid-thirties, very attractive.
Phoebe: Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
Phoebe: Hands.
Phoebe: Thank you. (Starts to exit.)
Phoebe: (coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)
Phoebe: Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, thats him! Thatshim!
Phoebe: Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
Phoebe: No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and seewhats he like. People tell doctors everything.
Phoebe: But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turnout to be the biggest jerks.
Phoebe: What else? What else?
Phoebe: Oh. Ah-uh.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Enter Pheebs.
Phoebe: Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would yourather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
Phoebe: Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it?Im sorry. (She moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)
Phoebe: Oh, Ill get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)
Phoebe: Relax, its not like were forking.
Phoebe: Yknow what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding asCliff sees something on TV.)
Phoebe: Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
Phoebe: Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here inyour room?
Phoebe: Okay. Okay. IOkay ummthisI-I sent my friend Joey inhere to find out stuff about you. Umm yknow, if it helps you came off great. A lotbetter than Im coming off right now.
Phoebe: Youre right, that was wrong. Im sorry. Im so sorry.Its just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
Phoebe: Uh Joey, were trying to dial down the crazy.
Phoebe: Umm, look we dont, we dont really know each other so itwould be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something betweenus. And I dont know about you but that doesnt happen to me a lot.
Phoebe: Can we come in?
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Oh, shes so beautiful.
Phoebe: Okay, my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! Youre socute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I wont.
Phoebe: Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)
Phoebe: Oh, wait a minute its not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that wasso original! 
Phoebe: Yay!
Phoebe: Is she in there?
Phoebe: Oh!
Phoebe: I just cant decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
Phoebe: Im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two togetheragain? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because youre not in that place.Which would be fine, except you totally are.
Phoebe: Yeah thats true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have achild together. There is no right answer.
Phoebe: I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you mightwreck it.
Phoebe: Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything youve wanted since youwere fifteen.
Phoebe: (To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.
Phoebe: To see if know what these guys are talking about.
Phoebe: (taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you andRachel?
Phoebe: Yay! Its so exciting! Wow, you couldve done that with usthere.
Phoebe: Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you canttalk to Rachel.
Phoebe: Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenianfamily was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still hasmy Gameboy.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Are you all right?
Phoebe: Oh my God! He did it?
Phoebe: Are you kidding? Im like the one who talked him into it. I like tothink of myself as the puppet master of the group.
Phoebe: I just talked him into it, dont tell me I have to do you too. Thepuppet master gets tired people.
Phoebe: Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
Phoebe: Especially Ross!
Phoebe: There he goes, your fiancée. 
Phoebe: Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
Phoebe: Oh hey! Wait up!
Phoebe: Congratulations! I didnt want to say anything in front of Joeycause I didnt know if he knew yet.
Phoebe: No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
Phoebe: Oh, its a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We havent done the secretthing in a long time.
Phoebe: Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that youwere a doctor?
Phoebe: All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that shessleeping.) Should we wake her up?
Phoebe: And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)
Phoebe: Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Yknow Rossdoctors are supposed to be smart.
Phoebe: Really?
Phoebe: So whose ring is it?
Phoebe: Is it an engagement ring?
Phoebe: But you didnt give it to her?
Phoebe: But you were going to propose?
Phoebe: Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
Phoebe: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Phoebe: No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
Phoebe: No they ran out of "Its a girl" but I can fix this one,(She writes "not" in between its and a) See?
Phoebe: Look at all the stuff people sent!
Phoebe: Shes just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and asucking candy.
Phoebe: Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!
Phoebe: I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thingreally quickly.
Phoebe: You know thats thats her.
Phoebe: Oh no, Rach, no no, you know youre never supposedto wake a sleeping baby.
Phoebe: I can say I told you so but shes kinda doing that for me.
Phoebe: It really does how long do you think we have to stay?
Phoebe: Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her,oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Phoebe: Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex withRoss!
Phoebe: Alright you guys, we cant turn on each other, Okay? Thats just what she wants.
Phoebe: Oh Im kinda part of this.
Phoebe: I knew I should have married Chandler.
Phoebe: Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so Imjust gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No!Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)
Phoebe: Alright, Ill try, fine! Yes, Okay!
Phoebe: Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)
Phoebe: I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow)
Phoebe: (entering) Have I gone deaf?
Phoebe: You must be a fireball in bed.
Phoebe: I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my headagain! (Monica looks at her strangely) Im kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)
Phoebe: Thankfully you dont need me at all (gets up and to leave) so OkaySuper aunt see you later! Rachel lets give it six to eight months (she leaves).
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: I call their apartment!!!
Phoebe: It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.  It's just so grown up.
Phoebe: Look at you all grown up.
Phoebe: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you  set me up with someone, and we double date!
Phoebe: Done. Oh good, really?
Phoebe: Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know  who's great? Sandy Poophack.

Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Do you not know each other?
Phoebe: Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters  does Joey have?
Phoebe: Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
Phoebe: (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time  finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and  cute and loose.
Phoebe: Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some  guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
Phoebe: I'm out of here (She leaves)
Phoebe: Sure.
Phoebe: Why did you go along with that?
Phoebe: That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me  about yourself true?
Phoebe: Prove it.
Phoebe: That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
Phoebe: You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
Phoebe: Uhuh.
Phoebe: Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right  now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.

Phoebe: yeah well (pause) yeah you know Emma's birth certificate  might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
Phoebe: I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You  know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: ok I can't do this.
Phoebe: well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because  I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with  a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. (Pause) if that's  too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close  my eye's make it less awkward (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses  her, Phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) You kissed me.
Phoebe: so you don't think I'm a total freak
Phoebe: I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you  kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls  back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
 Phoebe: you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your    whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious    relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you    go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience    never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
Phoebe: Oh hey you guys, I couldnt get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
Phoebe: So?
Phoebe: No! Its my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think its a little to soon to show my true colors.
Phoebe: Oh, Rachel!
Phoebe: Oh, yay!
Phoebe: Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all havent been together the six of us in such a long time.
Phoebe: (from outside) Trick or treat! (Its obviously Halloween eve, the night of her birthday dinner.)
Phoebe: Ooh, and treat it is. (Monicas breasts.)
Phoebe: Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that cant contain my breasts.
Phoebe: Ohh. Oh wait! (Jis) you guys wont be late for my dinner, will you?
Phoebe: kay, see you there. Happy humping! (outside meeting Chandler.) Heyhey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, dont people know, youre not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
Phoebe: You smoked!
Phoebe: (smells at him) Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
Phoebe: Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound  and the breasts of a Greek goddess.
Phoebe: (embarrassed) Im gonna go. (leaves to stairs)
Phoebe: Where is everyone? Theyre forty minutes late.
Phoebe: Im starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate nothing all day.
Phoebe: Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.
Phoebe: Joseph! (to waiter) Thou neednt worry, they shant be long.
Phoebe: One really does have a stick up ones ass. Doesnt one?
Phoebe: No, you cant go. No-no-no, I cant hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.
Phoebe: Okay, fine, Ill move. Alright, you dont have to manhandle me. (gets up) Where? (he points at a smaller table) Okay. Thank you. Wach.
Phoebe: Well, I guess theyre not coming. You wanna just order?
Phoebe: Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
Phoebe: Both it is, thank you.
Phoebe: You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
Phoebe: And thats Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
Phoebe: Wher-where have you been?
Phoebe: You guys, weve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
Phoebe: Aw  what?
Phoebe: s a good toast.
Phoebe: (getting up) Oh, for gods sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) Im sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didnt even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well, its too late now.
Phoebe: well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) Hello?
Phoebe: (returns) Okay, that was Mike.
Phoebe: Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, Im gonna take off.
Phoebe: Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, Im not tnot that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye.
Phoebe: Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
Phoebe: Hey, what's going on Joe? 
Phoebe: Oh okay. How about the whole "man walking on  the moon" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people! 
Phoebe: Ooh, honey. You stink at lying. 
Phoebe: Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday  at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin  was gone-who took it?
Phoebe: Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good  lie. I'll help you practice it.
Phoebe: Sure, what.. what was the work thing? 
Phoebe: "Pick up grandma at the airport"?
Phoebe: Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.  but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when  you're talking, people know you're lying. 
Phoebe: Thats a great movie. &lt;she claps&gt;
Amy turns around to Phoebe: Emma, Ross wants you. 
Phoebe: PHOE-BE.
Phoebe: There's your movie! &lt;claps&gt; 
Phoebe: It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's  easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the  parade because you had a family emergency. 
Phoebe: Ooh, what happened? 
Phoebe: No! Nothing with a raccoon. 
Phoebe: Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy  china for dessert too. 
Phoebe: Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
Phoebe: It's all right. You can mourn. 
Phoebe: Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
Phoebe: Broke them all, huh?
Phoebe: You gonna tell her?
Phoebe: No problem! Next week: stealing... (Chandler walks  away to store the box of broken china.)
Phoebe: ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"
Phoebe: (smiling) Uh-huh.
Phoebe: Oh, I like my job.
Phoebe: So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. (singing:)
Phoebe: Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Phoebe: No-no, we do it every year!
Phoebe: No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
Phoebe: Oh no, we have to!
Phoebe: Well then, you should look with us.
Phoebe: Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah.
Phoebe: Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Phoebe: Ooh, who's it for?
Phoebe: Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Phoebe: You guuuyys.
Phoebe: (simultaneous to the others) Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
Phoebe: (simultaneous to the others) Blah blargah, blar-blab.
Phoebe: (at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
Phoebe: Aren't we done with that?
Phoebe: Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
Phoebe: Now give me my real gift.
Phoebe: (to Chandler) Thank you.
Phoebe: Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
Phoebe: No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully   with a "to" in the middle.
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: (relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
Phoebe: Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who   I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on   the plate of cookies.
Phoebe: What are those?
Phoebe: OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
Phoebe: So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.   (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)
Phoebe: Hey Mikey
Phoebe: What are you doing?
Phoebe: To kill Bob??
Phoebe: No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna   capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can   maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
Phoebe: I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at   cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies!   Bob's a mom!
Phoebe: I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
Phoebe: Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Phoebe: Suzie? (Runs over there to check)
Phoebe: Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
Phoebe: I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility   now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're   a mother.
Phoebe: No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed   them.
Phoebe: Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone   can afford help. (she and Mike leave)
Phoebe: Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing   the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
Phoebe: Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
Phoebe: Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
Phoebe: No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what   are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then   each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers)   That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
Phoebe: Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away.   But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's   favorites. 
Phoebe: You must think I'm crazy.
Phoebe: Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go.   I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to   my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't   told you about that yet, have I?
Phoebe: (walks in) Hey
Phoebe: Listen, I think I've left something here.
Phoebe: (likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of   my rat babies.
Phoebe: (realizes) Ooh, maybe that's him!
Phoebe: Well it depends.
Phoebe: On how far along he's in the sex change process!
Phoebe: Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Phoebe: Wow! Talking about high maintenance
Phoebe: I'm a woman!
Phoebe: Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
Phoebe: But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.
Phoebe: Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
Phoebe: OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
Phoebe: While drinking...
Phoebe: Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
Phoebe: Oh my god.
Phoebe: It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
Phoebe: Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
Phoebe: "No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!
Phoebe: Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
Phoebe: But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
Phoebe: All the time when you're cooking.
Phoebe: Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"
Phoebe: OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
Phoebe: Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.
Phoebe: Can you totally see through her shirt ?
Phoebe: Every little bit of you!
Phoebe: Mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but...
Phoebe: Oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands.
Phoebe: Yes, she gives the people what they want.
Phoebe: Oh? Isn’t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.
Phoebe: Hey.
Phoebe: What you got?
Phoebe: Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart      from the great food.
Phoebe: Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
Phoebe: I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
Phoebe: I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
Phoebe: I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have      more children.
Phoebe: You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's      out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.
Phoebe: So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them      up with people?
Phoebe: Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel      up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.
Phoebe: Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh." (A      maniacal laugh follows.)
Phoebe: Ooh, Joey. 
Phoebe: Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight. 
Phoebe: Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold      down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah.
Phoebe: A teacher?
Phoebe: Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey,      you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! 
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: How do you even know a woman like that?
Phoebe: Joey.
Phoebe: So now what do we do?
Phoebe: What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the      date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets      stood up!
Phoebe: Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross      gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.
Phoebe: It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... (Laughs the real "plan-laugh.")
Phoebe: No, I think we killed it.
Phoebe: Hello?
Phoebe: Hey, Rach!
Phoebe: You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. 
Phoebe: Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
Phoebe: Did he go out for a cigarette? 
Phoebe: My dear, sweet Rach.
Phoebe: By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny      Mexico. (BEAT) Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
Phoebe: Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?
Phoebe: How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
Phoebe: Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.
Phoebe: Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.
Phoebe: Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.
Phoebe: Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out.      They're coming this way. Run!
Phoebe: Mexico!
Phoebe: Why??
Phoebe: Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
Phoebe: I want you to stay.
Phoebe: Why don't you turn them inside ou...
Phoebe: I'll miss you.
Phoebe: Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
Phoebe: Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell  yeah!"
Phoebe: Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! (They embrace and Mike kisses  Phoebe) Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
Phoebe: I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put  down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's  gonna be fun!
Phoebe: Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.
Phoebe: I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
Phoebe: Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
Phoebe: Uh huh...we're playing you two.
Phoebe: Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You  know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah.  Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that  highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house  in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send  Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
Phoebe: I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a  soccer mom!
Phoebe: Yeah! You bet roomy!
Phoebe: Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have  us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously.  They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)
Phoebe: China patterns!!!!!
Phoebe: Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's  a play on the word roomy.
Phoebe: Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where  it goes.
Phoebe: What do you mean?
Phoebe: Oh. Wow.
Phoebe: Was it really that bad?
Phoebe: Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with  someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in  the ocean.
Phoebe: But it's just...
Phoebe: Oh!
Phoebe: No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make  sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start  changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
Phoebe: Yeah I get that.
Phoebe: Hi
Phoebe: Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
Phoebe: No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Phoebe: Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
Phoebe: Never.
Phoebe: I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really  that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything.  That marriage stinks!
Phoebe: That's not how you really feel is it?
Phoebe: Seriously? You divorce-o?
Phoebe: It's ok that's how you feel.
Phoebe: I do love Mike.
Phoebe: Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
Phoebe: It's not cooler.
Phoebe: Better.
Phoebe: Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
Phoebe: What do you mean?
Phoebe: They are awfully boxy...
Phoebe: Uh huh.
Phoebe: Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle  room? None at all?
Phoebe: Right. Except that I do want to get married.
Phoebe: Someday.
Phoebe: I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was  missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the  regular stuff.
Phoebe: Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and  I wanted to live with you.
Phoebe: But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what  was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
Phoebe: Are you gonna change yours?
Phoebe: Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
Phoebe: I don't want it to end either.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Hi.
Phoebe: Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
Phoebe: Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this... 
Phoebe: Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
Phoebe: Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
Phoebe: (after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
Phoebe: That was a test and you just failed.
Phoebe: God, I wish Mike were here.
Phoebe: I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
Phoebe: Here.
Phoebe: Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)
Phoebe: Yes.
Phoebe: Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
Phoebe: You can't have it.
Phoebe: No (tucks it in her pants)
Phoebe: (disbelievingly) Oh yeah.
Phoebe: Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
Phoebe: You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
Phoebe: Those are my shoes.
Phoebe: Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
Phoebe: I ordered Chinese food.
Phoebe: What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Phoebe: I'm sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him.
Phoebe: There is a speakerphone on the base unit... 
Phoebe: Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
Phoebe: Sit down.
Phoebe: Thanks, you look good too.
Phoebe: So how's the piano playing going?
Phoebe: I've missed you too.
Phoebe: I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)
Phoebe: Who is this?
Phoebe: Hey will you get me tickets too?
Phoebe: You don't wanna win the lottery?
Phoebe: (excited)Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going tobelieve this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonnawin the lottery tonight!
Phoebe: Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat themeat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
Phoebe: I hope I win!
Phoebe: One, two, three!
Phoebe: Get a room!
Phoebe: Oooh, I like that, "daddy" (in a sexy tone)
Phoebe: (still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Isdaddy gonna spank me?
Phoebe: Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
Phoebe: Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
Phoebe: Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the ticketstogether (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)
Phoebe: (she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and shestarts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!
Phoebe: (keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (shestops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (shegoes out to the balcony)
Phoebe: If we are not doing it together, we're not doing itat all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, andmakes as to drop the tickets on the street).
Phoebe: Don't come any closer!
Phoebe: No, what's more important, your friends or money?
Phoebe: Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
Phoebe: Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There wasno way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebewho drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I brokeyour bowl.
Phoebe: What a beautiful night to be running around thestreet, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
Phoebe: So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! Mypsychic said I  was gonna win, remember?
Phoebe: As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going todie. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish.
Phoebe: Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
Phoebe: Guys, the drawing is about to start!
Phoebe: I'm still looking through mine...
Phoebe: You guys, what was the Powerball number again?
Phoebe: We won.
Phoebe: We won!
Phoebe: Don't tear it.
Phoebe: I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number,we've won 3 dollars!
Phoebe: (still very excited) I don't care, I've never wonanything before, I can't believe this!
Phoebe: It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
Phoebe: I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and herplate of cookies).
Phoebe: (hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the"pigeon voice" from before) Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. Itwas not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) Seriously, stopstaring at her.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Sure!
Phoebe: Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
Phoebe: Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
Phoebe: Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
Phoebe: Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
Phoebe: And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
Phoebe: (playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!
Phoebe: Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
Phoebe: Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: But what?
Phoebe: (pause) Ok, say no more.
Phoebe: (with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh?
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
Phoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
Phoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).
Phoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
Phoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
Phoebe: Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it"!
Phoebe: Well...it's not about quality.
Phoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
Phoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
Phoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini?
Phoebe: (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
Phoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
Phoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
Phoebe: (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Phoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!
Phoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
Phoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).
Phoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
Phoebe: I'm sorry too... (they hug)
Phoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... 
Phoebe: (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
Phoebe: What is it?
Phoebe: I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
Phoebe: Ah, ah.
Phoebe: Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
Phoebe: Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
Phoebe: And that horrible museum tour!
Phoebe: We know about your party Joey.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)
Phoebe: Hey Ross!
Phoebe: Oh, What's the matter?
Phoebe: Worse?
Phoebe: (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)
Phoebe: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
Phoebe: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.
Phoebe: You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
Phoebe: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
Phoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
Phoebe: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
Phoebe: Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids   and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh,   those nerds will get laaaaaid!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of   slippers)
Phoebe: I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania   Twain.
Phoebe: Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
Phoebe: (coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift   certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!
Phoebe: No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big   massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
Phoebe: Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's   about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
Phoebe: Well, do you care about friendship?
Phoebe: I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use   this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
Phoebe: Promise?
Phoebe: Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
Phoebe: Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She   sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone   who can fill in for me?
Phoebe: But that woman can't know I work   here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this   massage chains are.
Phoebe: 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that   this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
Phoebe: (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?
Phoebe: (In a strange heavy accent) Hello "ja", it's time   for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
Phoebe: Okay, then I'm Swedish...
Phoebe: It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
Phoebe: Ja!
Phoebe: (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!
Phoebe: Is something wrong?
Phoebe: (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.
Phoebe: (Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is   the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)
Phoebe: Oh, Ja! Ja!
Phoebe: Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
Phoebe: Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're   such a high maintenance tight ass!
Phoebe: You know it's me?
Phoebe: How can you come here?
Phoebe: I don't have to tell you everything!
Phoebe: Tips not included.
Phoebe: Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then   they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know...   you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh!   paying taxes!
Phoebe: You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time   I took my life back!
Phoebe: Ok.
Phoebe: Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and   whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any   of that. I love you.
Phoebe: (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist.
Phoebe: Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?
Phoebe: (through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for   your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
Phoebe: (entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?
Phoebe: Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
Phoebe: Exactly!
Phoebe: (after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh, sexual politics!!
Phoebe: Ok, that'll be great!
Phoebe: Oh, I'll take some of that.
Phoebe: No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah.
Phoebe: Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
Phoebe: (picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
Phoebe: Ok!
Phoebe: So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
Phoebe: Why?
Phoebe: Who else?
Phoebe: You like Joey?
Phoebe: (whispering) Oh my God!
Phoebe: Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
Phoebe: Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Sure!
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
Phoebe: Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
Phoebe: (sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!
Phoebe: (goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
Phoebe: (comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
Phoebe: Ooh! We have a problem.
Phoebe: Good plan.
Phoebe: Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"! (at which she walks away)
Phoebe: Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Phoebe: Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
Phoebe: You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
Phoebe: David?
Phoebe: Oh my God! (they hug)
Phoebe: Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
Phoebe: What happened?
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
Phoebe: Good!
Phoebe: (disappointed) Oh, good for you.
Phoebe: Mike and I broke up.
Phoebe: Really?
Phoebe: I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!
Phoebe: Well... (pause) no.
Phoebe: I'd love to.
Phoebe: Ok. (they walk away together)
Phoebe: Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
Phoebe: I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Phoebe: No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
Phoebe: Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
Phoebe: Mike?? Who's Mike?
Phoebe: That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
Phoebe: Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
Phoebe: I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
Phoebe: (shouts after David) Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
Phoebe: Not Joey.
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Are you leaving "The Supremes"? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)
Phoebe: Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
Phoebe: Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: "Mike, do you take Phoebe..." (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout "No! No!") You know, it's every girl's dream!
Phoebe: Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
Phoebe: Sure, ok, yeah.
Phoebe: Oh my God, Mike!
Phoebe: No, Mike's here.
Phoebe: What are you, what are you doing here?
Phoebe: (smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!
Phoebe: I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
Phoebe: David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
Phoebe: Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
Phoebe: Yes! (they hug)
Phoebe: Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!
Phoebe: ... and...?
Phoebe: All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
Phoebe: Nobody wins!
Phoebe: Yeah, I'm out.
Phoebe: Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
Phoebe: No idea! I though he was soft like you!
Phoebe: (picks up a coin from her bra) Monica, you call it.
Phoebe: Tails!
Phoebe: (smiling proudly) He was a lawyer!
Phoebe: (looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler) Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
Phoebe: C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
Phoebe: (pointing at Mike and shouting) I sleep with him!
Phoebe: (to Mike) Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.
Phoebe: Mike wins?
Phoebe: You can't do that!
Phoebe: Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
Phoebe: It's like watching porn!
Phoebe: Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have    some pride, for the love of God.
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
Phoebe: You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on  the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) "Oh, so sorry to catch you  on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call  me on my mo-Bile!"
Phoebe: Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel".  All right, who hasn't?
Phoebe: Ugh, Let's just cut her out!
Phoebe: Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and  dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could  baby-sit again.
Phoebe: Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about  Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
Phoebe: Ok, don’t hold thy breath!
Phoebe: Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!
Phoebe: (leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well  under torture!
Phoebe: I did!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: No.
Phoebe: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both  out of here?
Phoebe: (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Musty!
Phoebe: Well...kinda.
Phoebe: Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
Phoebe: (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my  God. Was Mike with him?
Phoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can  I talk to you outside for a minute?
Phoebe: Please, Monica? In the hall?
Phoebe: It was right after we were living together and you  were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and  shrill.
Phoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
Phoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't  keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only  one who ever clawed her way back in.
Phoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your  way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
Phoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right.
Phoebe: Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm...   when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood   to buy us food!
Rachel and Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
Phoebe: Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't   even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And   they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant   people!
Phoebe: Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
Phoebe: Joey, it's a birthday party.
Joey: Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song,   maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!Phoebe: So you’re gonna... hit on her?
Phoebe: Oh!
Phoebe: Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
Phoebe: Separate performances.
Phoebe: Sure, yeah!
Phoebe: (to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing   prepared?
Phoebe: That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to   hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts   singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma!   Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy   birthday Emma!
Phoebe: No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks   up a book). “Sex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.
Phoebe: And you know, I have a massage client soon.
Phoebe: Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonnago.
Phoebe: Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards   the bathroom and enter)
Phoebe: No, it did not.
Phoebe: Joey? How could you just let them leave?
Phoebe: Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client   waiting outside my door any minute!
Phoebe: Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as   the person who realized that, I get to go!
Phoebe: No, lets just draw straws.
Phoebe: (Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that!
Phoebe: Ok! I want the dolphin!
Phoebe: I'm too excited!
Phoebe: Go! Go!
Phoebe: Good job Alan!
Phoebe: Yeah, see you later!
Phoebe: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
Phoebe: Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
Phoebe: I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something,   you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
Phoebe: (pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.
Phoebe: (yelling at the top of her voice) Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Phoebe: YEAH!
Phoebe: Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
Phoebe: Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so   no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put   on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
Phoebe: Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking   at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my   seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can’t believe   it's been a whole year! 
Phoebe: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
Phoebe: YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE   AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S   OUR ANNIVERSARY!
Phoebe: Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.
Phoebe: Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!
Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
Phoebe: Well, mine was worse than that.
Phoebe: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the   big screen thing...
Phoebe: Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning   on proposing to me that same way last night!
Phoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna   propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean,   I said no in Barbados and now this!
Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
Phoebe: (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think  I should propose?
Phoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
Phoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points   to Ross and Chandler) like that?
Phoebe: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)
Phoebe: I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank   you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?
Phoebe: Well, I think you should wait.
Phoebe: Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the   nutrients.
Phoebe: Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)
Phoebe: That's not very enlightened!
Phoebe: Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!
Phoebe: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking   about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
Phoebe: (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider   it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose,   I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball   game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who   hides it in the cake.
Phoebe: It's in the cake, isn't it?
Phoebe: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm   sorry!
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring   finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was   wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)
Phoebe: Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)
Phoebe: Yes!
Phoebe: I love you more!
Phoebe: (she enters) Hey...
Phoebe: Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...   (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!
Phoebe: Well, it was really sweet, and like the  most romantic thing ever.
Phoebe: Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something for   you!
Phoebe: It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers   of all the guys I've dated.
Phoebe: I would, but you're the last one.
Phoebe: Oh, my first love! 
Phoebe: Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no,  he  was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave  at Omaha Beach.
Phoebe: (proud of herself) Oh yes, they are.
Phoebe: (looking at Monica entering) Hey! 
Phoebe: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing   out stuff, so Mike could move in.
Phoebe: Yeah. 
Phoebe: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did  you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
Monica: Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you  to give  up?Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me   to get rid of Gladys.
Phoebe: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh,  I know!! Oh, you should take her!
Phoebe: Why, you don't like her?
Phoebe: Really? You think?
Phoebe: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just   realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
Phoebe: Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
Phoebe: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me   keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news   is, Gladys is yours!
Phoebe: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know,   with the woman coming out of the frame.
Phoebe: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
Phoebe: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads,   she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the   coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours!
Phoebe: (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to   your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')
Phoebe: (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can   get rid of that French poster.
Phoebe: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it.   Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
Phoebe: Hey! (there's a pause)
Phoebe: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her   anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous   painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress   and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls   are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are   gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)
Phoebe: I knew it!
Phoebe: It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea   how expensive this stuff was!
Phoebe: So what did you two do about it?
Phoebe: But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
Phoebe: Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity   and we just got married at City Hall?
Phoebe: Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
Phoebe: Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she   gives him a check)
Phoebe: And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Phoebe: Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe: Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
Phoebe: Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
Phoebe: Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which   was on the counter)
Phoebe: Mhm... it's moist.
Phoebe: Hello, is this the creepy residence?
Phoebe: Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing   a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!
Phoebe: No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money   we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
Phoebe: We, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having   a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh,   please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex   image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) All right, well, who cares,   I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
Phoebe: City Hall.
Phoebe: It’s ok, it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want   is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)
Phoebe: Well, I’ll just ask for it back!
Phoebe: It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight,   because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
Phoebe: The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it   back.
Phoebe: Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t   want, but it turns out we do.
Phoebe: I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
Phoebe: Hey, that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important!   And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t   go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an   escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me”   or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty   little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)
Phoebe: (Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him. 
Phoebe: Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for   a few   seconds) Just like the kids I took the money from.
Phoebe: Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
Phoebe: And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't   shot   anyone in a really long time.
Phoebe: (to the Charity guy) We're back!
Phoebe: Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children. 
Phoebe: Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she   gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!
Phoebe: But... but... but we're giving you this!
Phoebe: (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) Well, this is very generous!
Phoebe: Oh, is that you?
Phoebe: Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
Phoebe: What are you gonna name the baby?
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
Phoebe: Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
Phoebe: Mandy.
Phoebe: No.
Phoebe: Fine, I'll give you her number.
Phoebe: SARAH!
Phoebe: Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Phoebe: Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
Phoebe: What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
Phoebe: That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
Phoebe: (to Rachel) Oh
Phoebe: Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!
Phoebe: Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
Phoebe: What? You know about the plate thing?
Phoebe: (to Joey) You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
Phoebe: Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
Phoebe: (to Ross) This place is awesome!
Phoebe: Wow!
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: What? They will be!
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
Phoebe: Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Phoebe: oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
Phoebe: Ooh, what's going on?
Phoebe: Good for you!
Phoebe: Of course we can. Congratulations. (they hug, but Joey shakes his head.)   Yay! (she gestures Joey to come and join in) Joey...
Phoebe: You okay with this?
Phoebe: Talking to Ross.
Phoebe: Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin   Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
Phoebe: She died.
Phoebe: Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across   the Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the   wrong one.
Phoebe: Yeah, she was just an agent.
Phoebe: Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about   everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
Phoebe: Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get   used to everything else.
Phoebe: Hey. Everything ok?
Phoebe: Estelle? Why?
Phoebe: I’m guessing she does.
Phoebe: Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you   will wait a minute before you call her.
Phoebe: Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.   (she leaves)
Phoebe: Man, tough week for Estelle!
Phoebe: Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?
Phoebe: No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
Phoebe: No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call   you (Joey considers it)
Phoebe: Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ...   is the key... to a happy heart.
Phoebe: (picking up her bag) All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her   to call you?
Phoebe: (on the other side of the line, still pretending to be Estelle) Joey,   it's Estelle. (Joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)
Phoebe: Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for   firing me.
Phoebe: Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
Phoebe: Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
Phoebe: (Looks around) It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with   the career. You're gonna be huge.
