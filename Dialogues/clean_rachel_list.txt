Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went toyour building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might behere and you are, you are!
Rachel: Hi, sure!
Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hourbefore the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I waslooking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turnedon by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when ithit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew lookedfamiliar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am Idoing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know whereto go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person Iknew who lived here in the city.
Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be anissue... [Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TVand are trying to figure out what is going on.]
Rachel: (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marryhim! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! 
Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it'slike, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're ashoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be ashoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want youto buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Rachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'lljust stay here with Monica. 
Rachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybeI don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Rachel: I'm all better now.
Rachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed forAruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Rachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm justgonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.
Rachel: Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I knowyou probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making lovewith your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talkingand dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, butyou just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)
Rachel: Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That'sthe difference!
Rachel: Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have nevermade coffee before in my entire life.
Rachel: Y'know, I figure if I canmake coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Rachel: Hello, Paul.
Rachel: So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Rachel: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Rachel: I can see that. You look like you slept witha hanger in your mouth.
Rachel: Oh, yeah.
Rachel: Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Rachel: Want a wedding dress?  Hardly used.
Rachel: Oh, look, wish me luck!
Rachel: I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) jobthings.
Rachel: Guess what? 
Rachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelveinterviews today. 
Rachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fiftypercent off! 
Rachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've gotgreat boots' boots! 
Rachel: Uh, credit card. 
Rachel: Um... my... father. 
Rachel: Oh God, come on youguys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. 
Rachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married. 
Rachel: Thank you. 
Rachel: No.  No, no, I'm notready!  How can I be ready?  "Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out theairplane without your parachute?"  Come on, I can't do this!
Rachel: I don't think so.
Rachel: Y'know what?  I thinkwe can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Rachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What? 
Ross and Rachel: Goodnight.
Rachel: Sorry- 
Rachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it- 
Rachel: Okay. 
Rachel: I knew. 
Rachel: I did. 
Rachel: Yeah, maybe... 
Rachel: Goodnight. 
Rachel: (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee? 
Rachel: I'm just serving it. 
Rachel: Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you givethis to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thankyou. (To the gang.) Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next timeyou're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. 
Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring? 
Rachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look underthe couch cushions.) 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back tohim... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in frontof your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without thering, which makes it so much harder... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in thekitchen with... 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Rachel: You're twins? 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start toleave.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love-and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Rachel: Barry? 
Rachel: (hesitates) Are you sure? 
Rachel: I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great! 
Rachel: I dumped him. 
Rachel: Oh, not much. I-I got a job. 
Rachel: Why are- why are you so tanned? 
Rachel: Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone? 
Rachel: Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?! 
Rachel: Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs! 
Rachel: And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye! 
Rachel: Okay.. 
Rachel: Wow. 
Rachel: What? 
Rachel: Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs toyou. And thank you for giving it to me. 
Rachel: (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barrytoday. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, Ireally do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end upgetting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairlineand your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,but I feel so much better now. 
Rachel: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? 
Rachel: Since when? 
Rachel: And everybody knows this? 
Rachel: (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!(Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an icedtea. I'm getting pretty good at this! 
Rachel: (leaving to serve others) Good for me! 
Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! 
Rachel: Chandler, what are you doing? 
Rachel: This Alan again? How's it goin'? 
Rachel: Well, then can we meet him? 
Rachel: What bank is this? 
Rachel: And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.) 
Rachel: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it. 
Rachel: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 
Rachel: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. 
Rachel: It's worse than the thumb! 
Rachel: Well, I-I could live without it. 
Rachel: "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work. 
Rachel: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. 
Rachel: (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants tospeak to you. 
Rachel: (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good. 
Rachel: Yeah. 
Rachel: I think he's across the hall. 
Rachel: Uh, Joey.. 
Rachel: We didn't change.. 
Rachel: (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays comingup- I wanted him to meet my family- 
Rachel: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. 
Rachel: See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)"If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." (Joey enters.) 
Rachel: Look-look-look-look-look, my first paycheck! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! 
Rachel: God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. Iwiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally(opensenvelope)not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-Chandler, look at that. 
Rachel: Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanneall scream and hug each other. 
Rachel: What are you guys doing here? 
Rachel: (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you areso big I can't believe it! 
Rachel: (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
Rachel: So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! 
Rachel: Okay. 
Rachel: What? Guys, I'm not. 
Rachel: I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I'vegot this job- 
Rachel: Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uhdead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the littlechocolate blobbies on the cookies. 
Rachel: What's that? 
Rachel: Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts todrink.) 
Rachel: Oh, God, ask them what they want. 
Rachel: But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
Rachel: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. theywanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, andI'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, thenyou can tell them I'm okay, okay? 
Rachel: Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!
Rachel: Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,everything. And for what? 
Rachel: ...Jack from downstairs? 
Rachel: Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up acow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- 
Rachel: But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it wasclear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... 
Rachel: Yeah. 
Rachel: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if itdoesn't come together? 
Rachel: Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don'tget magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? 
Rachel: I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean tobring you down. 
Rachel: Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer thedoor.) 
Rachel: (miserably) No, no, that's not what weordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. 
Rachel: Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? 
Rachel: Hello? Who are we spying on? 
Rachel: Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! 
Rachel: Yeah. 
Rachel: Oh please, they're having sex. 
Rachel: So, whaddya think George is like? 
Rachel: How long? 
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits upand the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentineTommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. 
Rachel: Hello? Like he was really gonna send youone? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. 
Rachel: I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monicaand Rachel start to squabble) 
Rachel: He is so cute! 
Rachel: Oh, okay. Will you take my place? 
Rachel: Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandlertakes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven'tbeen using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. 
Rachel: (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens)Never-never mind. 
Rachel: (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.
Rachel: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Rachel: (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?
Rachel: It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Rachel: Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. Hecalled me young lady.
Rachel: Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with threechoruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Rachel: Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Rachel: Who?
Rachel: Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Rachel: Sure.
Rachel: Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Rachel: But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Rachel: Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Rachel: Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Rachel: That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Rachel: What's that?
Rachel: Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposedto use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? 
Rachel: Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me.I'm a laundry virgin.
Rachel: (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about theseare white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Rachel: Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I cando this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
Rachel: What uh-oh?
Rachel: Ross, what's the matter?
Rachel: Come on, show me.
Rachel: Oh, everything's pink.
Rachel: Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a bigmarshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on myown! I can't even do laundry!
Rachel: Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Rachel: Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Rachel: I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Rachel: Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Rachel: All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have totake me with it! 
Rachel: (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
Rachel: I could not have done this without you.
Rachel: Are you sure?
Rachel: Oh, are you sure you're ok?
Rachel: Does it still hurt?
Rachel: Where's Chandler?
Rachel: (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey'spicture! This is so exciting!
Rachel: God. I feel violated.
Rachel: Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Rachel: What is it?
Rachel: Tah-daaah!
Rachel: Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used allthe attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don'tknow what that's for.
Rachel: Well, whaddya think?
Rachel: I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's anextra seat around the coffee table.
Rachel: Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent,but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Rachel: ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
Rachel: Who is being loud?
Rachel: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Rachel: Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
Rachel: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Rachel: Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Rachel: Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the musicof Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Rachel: Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Rachel: Wow, you guys, this is big.
Rachel: That had to hurt!
Rachel: Alright, somebody.
Rachel: Um... Ross?
Rachel: Oh come on, I already went.
Rachel: Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, thefoot of the bed. 
Rachel: I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know,where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Rachel: There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golfcourse. 
Rachel: No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Rachel: I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never havingthat kind of...
Rachel: Yeah right.
Rachel: (sigh) OK.
Rachel: You don't.
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: You do?
Rachel: Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)
Rachel: What are you shushing?
Rachel: Ahhhh!
Rachel: Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)
Rachel: Hmmm... this is so nice.
Rachel: OK.
Rachel: Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
Rachel: Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)
Rachel: During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Rachel: Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just foundthis cat and we're looking for the owner.
Rachel: Bob Buttons?
Rachel: Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, littlekitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
Rachel: Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)
Rachel: (entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, Iwant you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Rachel: And Joey....
Rachel: And Ross.
Rachel: (proudly) He doesn't speak much English.
Rachel: Look at that!
Rachel: Oh... Italy, I think.
Rachel: Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Rachel: Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Rachel: Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Rachel: I have absolutely no idea.
Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am Idoing? This is so un-me!
Rachel: God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were moreexciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
Rachel: Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothingin common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
Rachel: Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe,possibly, you might be... 
Rachel: Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to mybreasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Rachel: Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio.
Rachel: Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking toRome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.
Rachel: (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Rachel: So, um, did she...
Rachel: Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)
Rachel: Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Rachel: Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
Rachel: (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.
Rachel: Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Rachel: Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Rachel: (humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Rachel: You!
Rachel: (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Rachel: Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Rachel: Aww, look at the little thing.
Rachel: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Rachel: Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I waswondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Rachel: It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year wego skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started thewhole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Rachel: Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'mtrying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?(everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.
Rachel: Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, doyou think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Rachel: Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.(picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go. 
Rachel: Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Rachel: Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Rachel: No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop,shoop, shoop.
Rachel: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Rachel: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Rachel: Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
Rachel: Thank you. Thank you so much!
Rachel: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgivingdinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Rachel: Oh my god.
Rachel: Saw what?
Rachel: I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop,shoop.
Rachel: Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Rachel: Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, andhits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Rachel: I can't, I gotta go.
Rachel: Ok.
Rachel: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over thepark.
Rachel: We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Rachel: Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Rachel: No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Rachel: Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Rachel: (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn'tfor you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes agesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not.
Rachel: No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and Iobviously didn't have the keys.
Rachel: Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Rachel: Well, you should have.
Rachel: Because!
Rachel: Because!
Rachel: Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuckhere with you guys.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: By all means.
Rachel: And a crappy New Year.
Rachel: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Rachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They allprotest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Rachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, soI'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. 
Rachel: Phoebe, you're on.
Rachel: (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by populardemand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Rachel: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by mysixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I justshare too much?
Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...
Rachel: (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.
Rachel: Five.
Rachel: Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Rachel: Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who'swith who.
Rachel: Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Rachel: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman-this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was hercab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by myhair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'mgoing to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on mywhistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?
Rachel: Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
Rachel: The bll is drrbing!
Rachel: I can't kiss anyone.
Rachel: ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Rachel: Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)
Rachel: No way, forget it.
Rachel: Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! Icannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Rachel: Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)
Rachel: Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track oftime.
Rachel: Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written.No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become awriter.
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: What're you guys doing out here?
Rachel: Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Rachel: Goodbye, baby.
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now,do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!
Rachel: (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Rachel: (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Rachel: Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolutehonest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Rachel: Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Rachel: Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Rachel: Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touchingPaolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)
Rachel: Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Rachel: I know...
Rachel: I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling thingsthat I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him,I'm totally, totally...
Rachel: (to Ross) I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, Icouldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... 
Rachel: Pheebs!
Rachel: Oh, right, that's me!
Rachel: "Ooo," what?
Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
Rachel: No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase andshows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's.
Rachel: Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Rachel: Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Rachel: (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie,overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Rachel: All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I'veever had.
Rachel: I guess you don't.
Rachel: I need some milk.
Rachel: No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the otherday with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feelso..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!

Rachel: No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Rachel: Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Rachel: Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Rachel: Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Rachel: I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks overnear Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to becomepeople? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Rachel: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Rachel: C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Rachel: You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but itwas the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this littlelifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. 
Rachel: Hi, I'm Rachel.
Rachel: Bathroom's up there.
Rachel: Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in theshower?
Rachel: Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joeyand Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib. 
Rachel: Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Rachel: I thought it was Chandler!
Rachel: You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Rachel: We hate that guy.
Rachel: We're sorry.
Rachel: Wow.
Rachel: Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Rachel: What happened?
Rachel: Do what, do what?
Rachel: No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Rachel: Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Rachel: Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Rachel: Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we hadsex. (imitating) "Was it good for you?"
Rachel: How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Rachel: Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Rachel: Or?
Rachel: Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
Rachel: Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Rachel: Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Rachel: Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing theritual in the first place.
Rachel: (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxershorts.
Rachel: (looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Rachel: And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: So, um, will you bring the truck?
Rachel: Oh, my god.
Rachel: Oh, they're firemen guys.

Rachel: (to Ross) Cappuccino. (Hands it to him.) 
Rachel: And a nice hot cider for Monica. (Hands it to her.)

Rachel: ... the WENUS?
Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.
Rachel: No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Rachel: Career counselor?
Rachel: I don't!
Rachel: The meeting with the guy went great?
Rachel: What are you going to make?
Rachel: (pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?
Rachel: (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Rachel: So what are you guys going to do?
Rachel: My God! What happened to you?
Rachel: (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh,hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!

Rachel: OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Rachel: Let me, let me get you some wine!
Rachel: Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Rachel: You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Rachel: Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Rachel: No, yeah, Ive done that.
Rachel: Ive never done that.
Rachel: Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
Rachel: So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Rachel: Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Rachel: (Looking at the television) Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is"Urkel."
Rachel: Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down thelights" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monicas notestuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?
Rachel: So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Rachel: Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Rachel: Ooh, okay... good.
Rachel: Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating.(Imitating men at their worst) "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout aquickie before I go to work?"
Rachel: You dont even have cats.
Rachel: Well try to keep it down.
Rachel: Are you seein her again tonight?

Monica and Rachel: (Wistfully, shaking their heads) No.
Rachel: Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
Rachel: Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slepttogether yet, I mean, thats not serious.
Rachel: No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto therailing to reach the top of a pole) ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!(Screams.)
Rachel: (To Monica) Im okay! Im okay! (She knocks on Mr. Heckles'swindow.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Rachel: (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved ina few months ago.
Rachel: (as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Rachel: (as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss peoplearound, which I just love to do.
Rachel: (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, Iwas a cow?
Rachel: (as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Rachel: (as Monica) Hi, remember us?
Rachel: (as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.

Rachel: No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Rachel: Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the rightguy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. WithPaolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Rachel: Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who'slike, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Rachel: Hi, how was the movie?
Rachel: (To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow!
Rachel: Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she usedto be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying.Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing withMonica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in theshoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices thenewsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry.Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartmentholding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs outin the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died?Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices theopen door)
Rachel: I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Rachel: I don't know. The left one.
Rachel: Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Rachel: C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Rachel: Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonnakill me!

Rachel: Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Rachel: Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink ithere. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Rachel: Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Rachel: Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Rachel: Y'know Marcel?
Rachel: Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Rachel: I know, I know, I'm sorry-
Rachel: (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybodylooking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?
Rachel: See? I've even called Animal Control!
Rachel: Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Rachel: O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Rachel: Hi, thanks for coming.
Rachel: Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts hisarms around her and they act all sweetness and light)
Rachel: Turned out it was a hat.
Rachel: Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Rachel: Yes!!
Rachel: None.
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Marcel?
Rachel: Ross, you don't know that.
Rachel: Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do?You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks thesign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Rachel: Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Rachel: Ross.
Rachel: Ross.
Rachel: Ross!
Rachel: Then what's with all the bananas?
Rachel: Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
Rachel: Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecomingqueen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, Iwill lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, butplease do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here!Take it!
Rachel: Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her thatyou shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Rachel: Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great littleoutfit.
Rachel: Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Rachel: That'd be good.
Rachel: Barry?!
Ross and Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Oh, that is so sick.
Rachel: Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunchat the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and allthe butter squirts out...
Rachel: Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to,but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Rachel: Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just sonice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Rachel: Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like,Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Rachel: Why?
Rachel: All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it'sstupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
Rachel: Wow... Wow!
Rachel: I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
Rachel: Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Rachel: Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
Rachel: Well, what about Mindy?
Rachel: No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Rachel: No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. 
Rachel: Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
Rachel: I had a bra.
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)
Rachel: Oh, do I?
Rachel: (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.
Rachel: I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a historythere. 'S'like you and Carol.

Rachel: Get down?
Rachel: Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Rachel: Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me?I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camptogether... she taught me how to kiss..
Rachel: And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..

Rachel: Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
Rachel: Oh sure it is!
Rachel: Um, what- what would make you think that?
Rachel: (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when Iwas engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.

Rachel: And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I havewondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.

Rachel: What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Rachel: Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
Rachel: And if you need anything else, I(notices the handsome Dr.Franzblau)do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's...ex-husband's... sister's roommate.

Rachel: From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Rachel: Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it andI've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Rachel: Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would begoing out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don'twanna...
Rachel: Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Rachel: Who is it?
Rachel: C'mon up.
Rachel: Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Rachel: So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Rachel: Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Rachel: Ross, it's too hard.
Rachel: Ross, you're like my best friend.
Rachel: If we broke up, and I lost you...
Rachel: Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Rachel: I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Rachel: Wow.
Rachel: Right! You're right!
Rachel: You know what?
Rachel: I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am sosorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him herdrink) I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.

Rachel: Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that justkick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Rachel: Bye. (She closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)
Rachel: Yeah, sure.
Rachel: Did you talk to him?
Rachel: Then, no.
Rachel: (To Ross) Here's your lemonade.
Rachel: Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna chargeyou for that. 
Rachel: Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) Souh, what did you find out?
Rachel: How is that the silver lining?
Rachel: She didn't hang up either!
Rachel: (taking the phone and hanging it up) Sorry, I thought you were talkingto me.
Rachel: Okay!
Rachel: (to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happento me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he'sRrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Rachel: I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal withit. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)
Rachel: (poking her head in from her bedroom) Uh, morning. Do you guys think youcould close your eyes for just a sec?
Rachel: Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
Rachel: Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on yourway, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)
Rachel: I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Rachel: At his apartment. Is this juice?
Rachel: Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Rachel: Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
Rachel: Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Rachel: How is she?
Rachel: I'm okay.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rockbottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
Rachel: Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Rachel: I don't know, I don't know.
Rachel: (sticking her head in from the balcony) Wait, are you leaving?
Rachel: Well, can I talk to you for a sec? 
Rachel: Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just astupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um,second of all (Ross is laughing), what?
Rachel: No. No-no-no-no.
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: No, I think that was the whole all.
Rachel: No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guyfrom Planet of the Apes.
Rachel: You're welcome.
Rachel: Yeah, I forget which ones.
Rachel: (to Julie) Thank you. (under her breath to Chandler) What a bitch.
Rachel: (entering) Hey, guys, what's up.
Rachel: Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Rachel: You went shopping for fur?
Rachel: You bought boobs?
Rachel: Oh, this is so cute.
Rachel: Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Rachel: Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
Rachel: They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Rachel: Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in thepocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, andnotices she also grabbed a receipt.)
Rachel: Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53dollars?

Rachel: Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Rachel: Who?
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: You were with Julie?
Rachel: Oh. Oh my God. 
Rachel: Yeah, right.  Sure!
Rachel: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)
Rachel: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Rachel: Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?(Monica looks away.) Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be withyou right now. (Exits.)
Rachel: Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Rachel: Yes.
Rachel: Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guywho might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually(starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you.
Rachel: I love you too. (They hug.)
Rachel: (crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that.
Rachel: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, youknow, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us,though, right?
Rachel: Really? Me?
Rachel: Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Rachel: Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, itwas really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, butum, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um,Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Rachel: Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Rachel: All right, Julie.
Rachel: Bye. (After Julie exits.) What a manipulative bitch.
Rachel: Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Rachel: What song was that, Pheebs?
Rachel: Hey Mon!
Rachel: No, it's been three nights in a row.
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Rachel: Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together,they're really cute.
Rachel: Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's hisgirlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Rachel: (she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....
Rachel: Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
Rachel: Hmm.
Rachel: You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Rachel: Well honey, what about you?
Rachel: I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?

Rachel: Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Rachel: Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each othereverything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all thatlocker room stuff.
Rachel: Were both of those Joey?
Rachel: Not even with your best friend.
Rachel: That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bondingand the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the samething you are.
Rachel: Pretty much.
Rachel: Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Rachel: Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird lookon your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What?Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
Rachel: (entering from bathroom) Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Rachel: Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
Rachel: How come you didn't come over earlier?
Rachel: Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
Rachel: Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) You guys, (holds up an outfit) does this looklike something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Rachel: Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves lookfat. Nevermind.
Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) What?!

Rachel: Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my blackjacket? 
Rachel: No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out ofthat. Come on.
Rachel: Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Rachel: Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn'twork, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Rachel: Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Rachel: Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to thisthing as Little Bo Peep.
Rachel: Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Rachel: Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Rachel: No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
Rachel: (entering from her room) Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? Theblack or the purple?
Rachel: Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wearpants?
Rachel: But I...
Rachel: All right.
Rachel: I'm not gonna gooo.
Rachel: No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
Rachel: I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Rachel: Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'mjust, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Rachel: It's fine.
Rachel: I'm not mad. 
Rachel: I'm just not going.
Rachel: Right.
Rachel: Um, hum.
Rachel: No.
Rachel: Right.
Rachel: Right, and the humiliating.
Rachel: Um, hum.
Rachel: Right.
Rachel: Yes, Ross. (turns toward him)
Rachel: No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait aminute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
Rachel: I think you should drink the fat.
Rachel: No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Rachel: You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
Rachel: You were gonna drink the fat.
Rachel: And I still have about five seconds to spare. (kisses him) Okay, that wasabout seven seconds.
Rachel: Come on. (they start to leave) Oh! And, uh, by the way....
Rachel: I'm going commando, too.
Rachel: I didn't know there were docks.
Rachel: Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Rachel: Monica's making jam.
Rachel: Mon?
Rachel: (reading) 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Rachel: What?
Rachel: What, what, what?
Rachel: Oooh.
Rachel: Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross startskissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.(they fall onto the couch)
Rachel: Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey.
Ross and Rachel: Noo.
Rachel: Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Rachel: Nooo!
Rachel: Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Rachel: Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlilysleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work.

Rachel: Good luck Chandler.
Rachel: Bye hon.

Rachel: Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Rachel: Are you serious?
Rachel: Down at the docks again?
Rachel: Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Rachel: When did you go to a sperm bank?
Rachel: Phoebe, what are you doing?
Rachel: Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows howlong, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Rachel: Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)
Rachel: Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.

Rachel: Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Hello.
Rachel: Noo way, Kevin.
Rachel: Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?(uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)
Rachel: What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Rachel: Men are unbelievable.
Rachel: Amazingly, that makes sense.
Rachel: Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies andpretend agents.
Rachel: Very nice touch.
Rachel: Unbelievable.
Rachel: Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)
Rachel: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not sobad. How did you leave it?
Rachel: Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, wesave the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Rachel: Yeah, you do.
Rachel: This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reachingfor that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You wanther back you have to start acting aloof.
Rachel: Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into heron purpose. And then act aloof.
Rachel: Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
Rachel: Oh.
Rachel: G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Rachel: Yeah, it is.
Rachel: Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Yes, and grumpy.
Rachel: He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebodyelse by now.
Rachel: (joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs. 
Rachel: Any sign of your brother?
Rachel: I thought you only met him once?
Rachel: Well relax, hell be here.
Rachel: Well, actually Gunther sent me. Youre not allowed to have cups outhere, its a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)
Rachel: Now, you do realize that shes a cartoon, and way out of yourleague?
Rachel: Oh, I dont know, I guess, Chris ODonnel, John F. Kennedy,Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
Rachel: Hardy Boy.
Rachel: What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Rachel: Three of your five, what?
Rachel: Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Rachel: So?
Rachel: Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini,geography.
Rachel: Well, its about time.
Rachel: All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?

Rachel: Oh-oh, you lie.
Rachel: Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
Rachel: You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Honey, hes about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. Im justsorry we dont got popcorn.
Monica and Rachel: What?!!

Rachel: Thats all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get acouple drinks right, huh?
Rachel: Ummm, I think its time to see the ring again. (holds her hand outand they all scream)
Rachel: Yeah, I know.
Rachel: Oh, I dont know. Well maybe its just the idea of Barry forthe rest of my life. I dont know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling,y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)
Rachel: Im serious, I really, I think I need just to havesome...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Rachel: Yeah, so?
Rachel: Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)

Rachel: Gunther, Gunther, please, Ive worked here for two and a halfyears, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)
Rachel: Huh. Well, y'know thats actually a really good idea, because thatway theyll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitressesdo that too.
Rachel: Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that itwas a club they went to. Oh God, Im, Im sorry. (walks away)
Rachel: (sitting down next to Chandler) Im training to be better at a jobthat I hate, my life officially sucks.
Rachel: Well, yeah! Im still pursuing that.
Rachel: Well, Im also sending out.... good thoughts.
Rachel: The fear?
Rachel: Well then how come youre still at a job that you hate, I mean whydont you quit and get the fear?
Rachel: I dont know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer,y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just dont want to be 30 and still work here.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Cant I just look at the handles on them?
Rachel: Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you knowwhy Im a terrible waitress? Because, I dont care. I dont care. Idont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where thetray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do. So I dont thinkI should do it anymore. Im gonna give you my weeks notice.
Rachel: Gunther, I quit.
Rachel: (entering) Okay, stop what youre doing, I need envelope stuffers,I need stamp lickers.....
Rachel: Hey-hey-hey thats funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy!You wanna know what else is really funny?!

Rachel: Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Rachel: Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Rachel: Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I thinkwhy would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotelyrelated to the field theyre interested in.
Rachel: Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt.... I dont mindpaying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira,the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.

Rachel: Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Rachel: Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two peoplelove each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (shekisses him) 
Rachel: Where ya going? 
Rachel: Ohh, with who? 
Rachel: There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?!

Rachel: Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah,blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Rachel: Oh, that is so...
Rachel: Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming withme this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldnt go with Mark?
Rachel: Its not dumb. But, maybe its okay that youre not apart of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean its like, I-I-I likethat youre not involved in that part of my life.
Rachel: Honey see, it doesnt mean that I dont love you. Because Ido. I love you, I love you so much. But my work its-its for me y'know,Im out there, on my own, and Im doing it and its scary but I love it,because its mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?

Rachel: Yeah, but its okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Rachel: No.
Rachel: No, no-no, its okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realisedhow much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want tomake it work.
Rachel: (on answering machine) Hi, its me. Ive been trying to reachyou all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me andMark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. 
Rachel: Eh, Im just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, Idont want to get back together over a machine.
Rachel: So, I love you.

Rachel: Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Rachel: God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Rachel: Oh, that is so sweet. I think Im falling in love with you all overagain.
Rachel: All right. Lets say I had slept with Mark. Would you have beenable to forgive me?
Rachel: Youd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been nakedwith me, and made love to me?
Rachel: You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Rachel: Im thinking, Im gonna order a pizza.
Rachel: Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, Id like to order a large pizza.
Rachel: With ah, extra anchovies.
Rachel: Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there inthe sauce?
Rachel: Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
Rachel: Thats....
Rachel: That is neither here nor there.
Rachel: No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Dont! You cantjust kiss me and think youre gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesnt workthat way. It doesnt just make it better. Okay?
Rachel: (softly) I think you should go.
Rachel: (softly) I really think you need to go now.
Rachel: Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Rachel: (crying) No. I cant, youre a totally different person to menow. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and nowI just cant stop picturing with her, I cant, (Ross stands up and backs away)it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. Its just changed,everything. Forever.

Rachel: No, I think its very obvious whos wrong here.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Thank you.
Rachel: Well, Im really sick of your smoking, so I brought something thatis going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)
Rachel: Come on, its a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for twoweeks straight and she hasnt smoked since.
Rachel: (to Ross) Whats your problem?
Rachel: Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Rachel: Oh right, cause you always pull your pants down at the count ofthree and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Rachel: Oh, y'know what, I didnt want cinnamon on this.
Rachel: Oh my God!! Great!
Rachel: Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and allI meet are eligible straight men.
Rachel: (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I meanthat aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean. That wig all indisarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. 
Rachel: I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Rachel: Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?
Rachel: All right.
Rachel: Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: Thank you.
Rachel: Hey Mon, lets give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seemsreally nice, and that check thing was adorable.
Rachel: We use it!!
Rachel: Oh my God, Monicas gonna go out with a millionaire. 
Rachel: Oh my God, I cant believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this isjust so exciting.
Rachel: Oh yeah, sure, that too.
Rachel: Oh my God! The millionaires here!
Rachel: Hi!!
Rachel: Just one drink?!
Rachel: Thank you.
Rachel: Hi! All right, lets go shoppin!!
Rachel: Oh, okay.
Rachel: Wow! Umm....
Rachel: I know.
Rachel: Well, I told him I would think about it, but Im gonna tell him no.
Rachel: I mean I think Id say no to anybody right now. (Hearing thisGunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean Imstanding there with this charming, cute guy, whos asking me to go out with him,which Im allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like Id be cheating on Rossor something.
Rachel: I dont have any issues with my Father.
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Yeah. Ahh, heres a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)
Rachel: Oh, y'know, its just like hats, and a shirt, and CDs, justsort of stuff that youve left here.

Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: Good.
Rachel: Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Rachel: Okay, all right, give me the mug! Ill keep the mug.
Rachel: You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where thatT-shirt!

Rachel: Huh?
Rachel: You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesnt evenfit you anymore!
Rachel: (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
Rachel: Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them ismissing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!
Rachel: Y'know what?
Rachel: I cant do this.
Rachel: Well, oh, Mark, Im doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?Im just doing it to get back at Ross. Im sorry, its not very fair toyou.
Rachel: Oh God. Im sorry about this.
Rachel: You sure?
Rachel: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair.
Rachel: Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. Im just gonna throw itout, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)
Rachel: (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and takea deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)
Rachel: Hey, Sophie!

Rachel: Why hasnt he called Rachel? Why? Why? I dont understand.Why? He said hell call. Why? Why? Chandler Im telling you she has flipped out,shes gone crazy!
Rachel: Come on, this isnt funny. She thinks its my fault that youhavent called her. You have to call her!
Rachel: Well then youre going to have to take her out again.
Rachel: I dont care! I dont care! You are going to have to take herout again and end it, and end it in way that she knows its actually ended. And, Idont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Rachel: Thats fine!

Rachel: Good! Cause Ive got a product report to read, its likeeight pages, I hope I dont fall asleep.
Rachel: (sees Chips phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called.I wonder what he wants?

Rachel: Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Rachel: (on phone) Chip! Hi, its Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah,umm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens)Monica Geller. (listens) Ohh.
Rachel: Why? I love that thing.

Rachel: Monica! I couldnt find him for two hours! He was having sex withAmy Welch!
Rachel: I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Rachel: Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same highschool.
Rachel: (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!
Rachel: (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Rachel: Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) 
Rachel: Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and gohave sex with another guy?
Rachel: I believe it.
Rachel: Yes, I do.
Rachel: Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
Rachel: Jurassic Park could happen.
Rachel: (entering) You guys, youre never gonna believe what I just foundtacked up on a telephone pole! (Shes holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?
Rachel: You guys, theres a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. Imean, you know what that means?!
Rachel: Do we have to tell her?
Rachel: I hate when Ross is right!
Rachel: Pheebs...
Rachel: All right!!
Rachel: Jeez!
Rachel: Hello, Chip.
Rachel: Im great! Im great. Ive got a great job at Bloomingdales,have wonderful friends, and eventhough Im not seeing anyone right now, Ivenever felt better about myself.
Rachel: Shell be out in a second. So, Chip, hows umm, Amy Welch?
Rachel: Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Rachel: (to Monica) So, how was your date?
Rachel: Um-hmm.

Rachel: I dont understand! Last time you went out with her yousaid she was a big, dull dud.
Rachel: Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will endit.
Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Rachel: Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Rachel: Thats weird, she locked the door.
Rachel: Okay, swear you wont tell, but when Mark left he gave mea key to Joannas office. Do you wanna see the list?
Rachel: (answering it) (angrily) What?!
Rachel: You promised you would break up with her!
Rachel: And the fact that you were jeopardising my career neverentered your mind?!
Rachel: Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, youget yourself out of them.

Rachel: You never come into this office again!
Rachel: You give me back my Walkman!
Rachel: Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Rachel: Does it hurt?
Rachel: Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Rachel: When she sees that youre gone, shes gonna knowthat I let you out, and that I was in here, and Im gonna get fired!
Rachel: No, theres nothing to make up, shes gonna knowthat I have a key to her office, Ive got to get you locked up back the way you were!(She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)
Rachel: Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up backthe way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, shes very private about her office.Now I know why.
Rachel: What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Rachel: Foot rubs for a month!

Rachel: (happily) Yeah!!
Rachel: Doh!! (pause) Ive got it!
Rachel: I have so got it. Theres gonna berumours about this, theres no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
Rachel: Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can bevery generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.
Rachel: I can make you a legend. I can make you this generationsMilton Berle.
Rachel: Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)
Rachel: So did you break up with Joanna?
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Its me! Good morning!

Rachel: Hey! So, did you quit?
Rachel: Oh, umm, I was just yknow working out and umm Oh,thats it.
Rachel: Where?!
Rachel: (laughing) What was that?
Rachel: You just did a little dancy thing.
Rachel: You are soo enjoying this.
Rachel: Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Rachel: What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Rachel: You got fired?! 
Rachel: Sweety...
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: May fifth, why?
Rachel: Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese,and you didn't even kiss her.
Rachel: Well, have fun!
Rachel: Yeah, she's...
Rachel: You love her.
Rachel: (entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are myfriends, and that's Ross.
Rachel: Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that'sright. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Rachel: Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him apassionate kiss.) I'll miss you.
Rachel: I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a funrelationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set footin a museum.
Rachel: Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for theadult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Rachel: What was that?
Rachel: Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!
Rachel: Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonnamarry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!
Rachel: I think he's stealing from me.
Rachel: Because he's stealing from me!
Rachel: Ughh! (Storms out after him)
Rachel: Well where's Amanda?
Rachel: I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could goup to your old room, and not make out.
Rachel: Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorryI forgot, she's not a lesbian.
Rachel: (laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad.
Rachel: Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me somethingwith it! (Shows her, her ring)
Rachel: Sorry.
Rachel: Y'know...
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: No!
Rachel: (confused) Okay.
Rachel: (really confused) Okay.
Rachel: Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobicsinstructor, what? 
Rachel: Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who canbring home the biggest geek. 
Rachel: Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes therabbit real! 
Rachel: Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So thisis pretty rare. How did you get that? 
Rachel: Oh, honey, that's so sweet. 
Rachel: Oh my God! What happened? 
Rachel: Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Rachel: And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love." 
Rachel: No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answersand I really want to finish a whole one without any help. 
Rachel: Hey, how'd it go? 
Rachel: You know what we should all do? Go see a musical. 
Rachel: And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do youhappen to know the name of that one? 
Rachel: No.... 
Rachel: Yes! Rent! 
Rachel: What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy. 
Rachel: What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up apen.) 
Rachel: Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift,maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives? 
Rachel: Any luck? 
Rachel: All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her theclock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen. 
Rachel: Aw, honey, that's so sweet. 
Rachel: Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.) 
Rachel: I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody tohug! 
Rachel: Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me! 
Rachel: Thanks! 
Rachel: Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go? 
Rachel: Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Rachel: Oh, I cant believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Rachel: Why not?
Rachel: Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Rachel: Yeah, Phoebe youre awful!
Rachel: I know, I remember that!
Rachel: Well, Chandler, youre gonna have to tell him.
Rachel: Because you do.
Rachel: Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There arerats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: So are things with you and Joey any better?
Rachel: Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of thoseplug-in telephone headsets huh?
Rachel: You shouldnt.
Rachel: Well, Im gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
Rachel: I know, but all that work youre doing to get it ready, Ijust (goes into her bedroom.)
Rachel: (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!
Rachel: Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
Rachel: Ooh, so cute, that Im thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Rachel: I know, its sick.
Rachel: Because its Richards son! Its like inviting Greektragedy over for dinner!
Rachel: Is he okay in there?
Rachel: So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Rachel: (worried) Why?
Rachel: Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)
Rachel: (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. Iwear it all the time.
Rachel: Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. 
Rachel: Well isnt it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoyand that I can get a lot of use out of?
Rachel: Credit. 
Rachel: Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
Rachel: (Swears in Italian, its the same term used by Joey earlier andJoey nods his approval.)
Rachel: Fancy soap? I thought we were savin that for the Pope!
Rachel: (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.
Rachel: Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Rachel: Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Rachel: Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)
Rachel: Dont say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Rosswhats in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshellfrom the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from themuseum from the first time we were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,but I keep the things that matter! 
Rachel: Joey, had reasons. 
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Oh, he sees her!
Rachel: No?
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something.Theres an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss
Rachel: Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting peopleall day and
Rachel: God, I am so glad you dont have a problem with this, because ifyou did, I wouldnt even consider applying.
Rachel: (interrupting) And thats Im so glad theres noproblem.
Rachel: Ohh! Thats great!
Rachel: Really?!
Rachel: Well, I, umm
Rachel: Thank you.
Rachel: Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
Rachel: Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Rachel: I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Rachel: Yes, I realize that
Rachel: I love working with designers!
Rachel: (entering Joannas office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about thatinterview.
Rachel: No! It didnt! Thats what I want to talk to you about.(starts to break up) Now, just to brief you (starts to cry) I may cry, but they arenot tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Rachel: Theres nobody here!
Rachel: Do you want me to quit?
Rachel: Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if youbelieve any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Yknow what? Iam just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk,which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizesshe has nothing.) Well, I guess theres no use to me sticking around til theend of the day! (Starts to leave.)
Rachel: What?
Rachel: My drinking? 
Rachel: Said what? Exactly.
Rachel: Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horribleperson!
Rachel: Say more things like that.
Rachel: Id need an expense account.
Rachel: And an assistant.
Rachel: Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look onan assistant buyer?
Rachel: Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole wayhome, but Im soo happy!
Rachel: Ohh, youve waited soo long. 
Rachel: Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Rachel: How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdales?
Rachel: Yes!!!
Rachel: Ohh, its gonna be so great! Im gonna get to help decide whatwe sell, Im gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica)Im gonna have walls!
Rachel: Im an assistant buyer!!
Rachel: Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Rachel: Heard what?
Rachel: Oh my God! How?!
Rachel: Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Rachel: Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God.
Rachel: Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is anemotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send anypaperwork your way before it happened.
Rachel: Yes-yes, just a few seconds and shed still be with usnothingabout an assistant buyer?
Rachel: Oh, Sophie, I guess you didnt hear about Joanna
Rachel: Hey, yknow, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hatebeing alone this time of year! Next thing you know itll be Valentines Day,then my birthday, then bang!before you know it, theyre lighting that damn treeagain. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in)Yknow, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, itdoesnt even have to be a big relationship, yknow, just like a fling would begreat.
Rachel: Well, believe me, its been a long time since Ive been flung.
Rachel: Yeah! Wait a minute, its been a long time that Ive beensingle. How come you never offered this before?
Rachel: Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I dont likeguys with boring jobs.
Rachel: Hey, honey! Whats the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, Iwas just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Rachel: Well, wait a minute, youre the boss! Why dont you just yellat them? Or, fire them?
Rachel: Pheebs, thats great!
Rachel: But yknow umm, Rachel doesnt rhyme with draddle.
Rachel: Oh yeah!
Rachel: Really?!
Rachel: So, will I like any of these guys?
Rachel: Chandler!
Rachel: Ohh, I like swimmers bodies!
Rachel: Op, I like credit cards!
Rachel: Well, so what does he do?
Rachel: Your company has a fine foods division?
Rachel: (entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Rachel: Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think thiscould maybe turn into something serious.
Rachel: Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didnt tell him that, though?Right?
Rachel: You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tellthe guy that!
Rachel: Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me puttingout on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.
Rachel: Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you nottell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Rachel: You idiot!!
Rachel: You dont tell a guy that youre looking for a seriousrelationship! You dont tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Rachel: Yknow, you should never be allowed to talk topeople!
Rachel: Oh! See just Im right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Beingalone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: No.
Rachel: Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Rachel: Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)
Rachel: What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Rachel: But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Rachel: Well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaurexpert or something?
Chandler, Monica, and Rachel:  Great!! Thats great!
Rachel: Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there arethings to think about.
Rachel: Wow! I dont know if I could ever do that. I always figured thefirst time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be akeeper.
Rachel: Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Likeyour mom?
Rachel: You guys are really rightthere arent you?
Rachel: Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
Rachel: Why? Just because youre not mature enough to understand somethinglike that?!
Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: Yeah, you should, really.
Rachel: Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but hedoes wave.
Rachel: Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.
Rachel: Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.
Rachel: Well, yknow, sometimes that helps. (She realises what thatcouldve meant.)
Rachel: Well if you go to Disneyland, you dont spend the wholeday on the Materhorn.
Rachel: Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)
Rachel: Oo, I cant watch this, its like Sophies Choice.
Rachel: Ooh, it was only okay.
Rachel: It depends on who asked.
Rachel: Oh, Mon, sure.
Rachel: Yes. (Pause) Youre not asking are you?
Rachel: Yes! Totally!
Rachel: What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Isthat you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.)Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joeys with Monica in trail.) 
Rachel: (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Getup! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
Rachel: What is that noise?
Rachel: Well, Ive been up since six. Thanks to somebodysdumb-ass rooster.
Rachel: Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Im so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Rachel: How many guesses do you get?
Rachel: No! Theres no orange juice in there! We win!! 
Rachel: Okay, well, we won that one.
Rachel: Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personalquestions.
Rachel: Fine! Well ask Phoebe.
Rachel: I know! I know, its such a huge, life-altering thing.
Rachel: Tails!
Rachel: Well take Literature!!
Rachel: Chandler gets it! Its Chandler Bing!
Rachel: (shouting) Its All Relative!!
Rachel: (shouting) Im sorry!
Rachel: Monica, I dont want to lose 200 dollars.
Rachel: Monica?!
Rachel: Okay, so lets play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
Rachel: Oooohh thats interesting.
Rachel: Throw in the duck too!
Rachel: Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Rachel: Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this.
Rachel: Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
Rachel: All right, lets do it.
Rachel: Okay. (They go into the living room.)
Rachel: All right!
Rachel: 14?
Rachel: Space cowboy!
Rachel: Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
Rachel: He carries a briefcase.
Rachel: Oh-oh-oh, hes a transponcetranspondster!
Rachel: Oh my God.
Rachel: (entering from Chandlers bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosballtable.) Oh my God! I cant believe you guys are actually think youre moving inhere!
Rachel: Well I-I-Im not moving.
Rachel: No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Rachel: Noooo.
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: I dont care, Im not going anywhere.
Rachel: No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartmentand I like it! This is a girls apartment! That is a boys apartment, itsdirty and it smells. This is pretty. Its-its so pretty! And look, andits-its purple! And Im telling you, you with the steady hand, I am notmoving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which isshaking uncontrollably.) 
Rachel: Thats right! You do what the hand says!
Rachel: How did it go?
Rachel: Yknow what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Rachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Rachel: Well it stupid, unfair question!
Rachel: Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Rachel: No its not!
Rachel: Oh, I think I saw some in here. 
Rachel: I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itlldie.
Rachel: Bloomingdales eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)
Rachel: No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a hugestep down!
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Rachel: (on the phone) Monica, Im quitting! I just helped an 81 year oldwoman put on a thong and she didnt even buy it! (Pause) Im telling youIm quitting! Thats it! Im talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes Iam! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when youget this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ahreally need to talk to you.
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Hi, Im Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Rachel: Oh, Im so sorry.
Rachel: Well, at least thats a great suit.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: No-no, that wasnt me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Letme show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.
Rachel: Oh-oh, sorry, its this way, its this way. (Motions to thecorrect way.)
Rachel: I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came overtoday, and I got to dress him up all day!
Rachel: Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump themtogether and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realisedit, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
Rachel: Hi-e!!
Rachel: Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to bethere.
Rachel: Its Joshua.

Rachel: Yeah, thats true.
Rachel: Chandler, what did she say?
Rachel: Beefsteak Charlies?
Rachel: Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joeys.) Oh, hey, do youneed help with that?
Rachel: Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler andJoeys.)
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.Its just so frustrating!
Rachel: Really? It doesnt seem desperate?
Rachel: Hmm-mmm.
Rachel: Yeah but, Ive never asked a guy out before.
Rachel: No. Have you?
Rachel: I dont even know how I would go about it.
Rachel: You know what, Im gonna do that, Im gonna call him up, andIm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin?(Calls him) Hi! Joshua? Its Rachel Green from Bloomingdales.(Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the storetoday? Well, we found a wallet, and we(Listens) the license? Well, that is agood idea! Uh, well, lets see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh,belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. Illsee you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) Youve done that a thousand times?
Rachel: Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Rachel: Really?! You think that will work?
Rachel: Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) Youknow, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too (Tries again.)Umm, who likes the Knicks(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)
Rachel: Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!

Rachel: He didnt turn me down! Hes at the game isnt he? I gotthe date, Im just not on it!
Rachel: Wow! Monica!
Rachel: Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, itdoes not justify her sleeping with someone.
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license andholds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs,and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left mywallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, Im glad.Rachel, Id like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin?
Rachel: How does going to a strip club help him better?

Rachel: Heywhoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joeyruns off.) Wow!
Rachel: Well, I didnt see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girlin the face.
Rachel: The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I gotthere, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Rachel: No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us andshe was all, "Im Rachel Greep! Im Rachel Greep!" and he let herright in. 
Rachel: No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to stealmy umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I cant believe this, all I wanted was a fewhours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
Rachel: Honey, thats youre name.
Rachel: What? Who the hell is Emily(realises) noooo!!
Rachel: Theyre in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her armsfranticly and hits Chandler.)
Rachel: Howhow did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hitsChandler again.)
Rachel: I dont get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)
Rachel: I dont care! All right, yknow what Im just upset thatIm getting nowhere with Joshua thatyknow what still, you do not meetsomeone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Rachel: Oh, yknow, would you just for once, not remembereverylittlething!! (Storms out.)
Rachel: (joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didntcall. I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Rachel: (entering) I cant believe it! He still hasnt called.
Rachel: Its Joshua.
Rachel: No, I dont.
Rachel: Yeah, come on! Whats going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)
Rachel: See, I dont know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Rachel: Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck thatdollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh
Rachel: Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Rachel: Oh, hey!
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Oh, hmm.
Rachel: Joshua.
Rachel: Yeah, I
Rachel: Oh, thank goodness!
Rachel: Oh, no problem. Im so glad I could help. Happy for you. (Sheplayfully punches him.)
Rachel: No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)
Rachel: No-no-no, that not Joshua.
Rachel: Chandler, theres a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)
Rachel: Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of aguy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does!(Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hateto think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Rachel: Hmm.
Rachel: Well, heres another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what thatsilver knob on the toilet does?
Rachel: Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mindactually using it?
Rachel: Guess who we ran into today?!
Rachel: You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Rachel: (entering, with Joey) Hey!
Rachel: Yknow, you-you also couldve used uh, lamps and thenfollowed the light.
Rachel: Its coming from Joey!
Rachel: Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Rachel: (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) Im sorry. Im sorry.Youre right, you are a tough guy. Youre the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Rachel: Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin at him.
Rachel: Youarenot going to believe it! Joshua came into work today,and guess what happened?
Rachel: No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Rachel: (refers to the table) What are these?
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Rachel: Wow! If only more people knew.
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that werent thereoriginally.) What-what are-what are these?
Rachel: Oh my God! Look at this!
Rachel: I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Rachel: And did you?!
Rachel: Oh my God.
Rachel: Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Rachel: Thank God.
Rachel: Well, Joshuas coming in tomorrow and since I dont have theguts to ask him out, Im going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Rachel: Oh, heres that trench-coat that you wanted.
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they dont want you to put yourhands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Rachel: Well, thats because of a lot of(She imitates someone pickingtheir nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)
Rachel: I know!
Rachel: Oh?
Rachel: Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Rachel: Huh. Well, uh, thats uh, thats interesting. (She goes overand retrieves her note.)
Rachel: Oh, its just an anti-theft device.
Rachel: You need that, you need that too cause obviously, a thief couldjust tear this up. (Rips up the note.)
Rachel: Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, wehave to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
Rachel: We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But itsactually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said hes not ready todate, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now Ihave the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)
Rachel: Surprise!!!
Rachel: Well, it was all Rosss idea.
Rachel: Uhh, because Im trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick heslooking over here, say something funny.
Rachel: Okay, yknow what, yknow what? This playing hard to get thingis not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (Shedoes a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!
Rachel: Care for a cherry?
Rachel: No? Yknow, I can tie one of these into a knot using just mytongue. 
Rachel: Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Rachel: Up!
Rachel: Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Rachel: Ohh, God! Look at him, hes so cute. I wanna go over there, grabhim, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Its not Christmas!
Rachel: Hes not 11!
Rachel: What? Youre leaving?!
Rachel: No! You guys cant leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the wholebig thing planned!
Rachel: (spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin thebottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to whereGunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunthers face and decidesnot to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
Rachel: Yay! Emily! 
Rachel: Okay, my turn!!
Rachel: Its okay! Its okay! It kicked once, itll kick again!
Rachel: All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting. 
Rachel: Just a bug.
Rachel: No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dresswasnt working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-byecheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an E!

Rachel: Im fine! Im fine! Im just losing a tooth, its nobig deal. I have a dentist! Yknow. Im gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.(She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I donow?
Rachel: All right, come on, lets go get your coat.
Rachel: Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Yknow, this braReally, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Yknow, this used to be mybedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls couldtalk, yknow what theyd say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violentlypulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isnt co-operating.)
Rachel: Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Rachel: Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is nothow this is supposed to happen.
Rachel: Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought thatif I could get you here, I could seduce you.

Rachel: Oh, now see thats a fancy but.
Rachel: But.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshuas gone soyou and Emily are free to go.
Rachel: Oh, Ross, Im sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Rachel: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Rachel: Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Rachel: Im so sorry.
Rachel: Well, maybe you didnt want it to end?
Rachel: You seem to really like her.
Rachel: Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monicas photo albums, I mean youdont do that if youre just in it for two weeks.
Rachel: Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, andyoure sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: I dont know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Youre a pathetic loser, right?
Rachel: Sit!
Rachel: Oh my gosh, Joshua!
Rachel: Theyre not true?
Rachel: Oh.
Rachel: Oh! Oh, I love that but.
Rachel: You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Rachel: Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.
Rachel: All right, yknow what, come on, do we really have to watch thiswhile we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)
Rachel: Honey, what are you doing? Thats too heavy.
Rachel: Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monicaright away.)
Rachel: Is that the heartbeat?
Rachel: Oh wow! This is so cool.
Rachel: Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Rachel: Whats that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Rachel: Yknow who doesnt even like dirty movies? My new boyfriendJoshua.
Rachel: No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Rachel: Yes!
Rachel: Im going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are tooskinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?
Rachel: Well, what-what cha got there?
Rachel: Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alicejust by selling knives.

Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!
Rachel: Well, well I can up with it!

Rachel: Okay, its not Relaxi Cab. Its Relaxicab, like taxicab. 
Rachel: Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first timetonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (Shes holding two frilly,lace nighties.)
Rachel: Sorry. Im so exited! Ive been waiting for this for months! Igot my hair coloured! I got new sheets! Im making him a very fancy meal. 
Rachel: What am I making him by the way?
Rachel: I thought I was making him filet mignon? 
Rachel: Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
Rachel: Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!
Rachel: (taking a bite) Hmmm!
Rachel: Oh I know, my God, this is sothis rice is soI am so good.

Rachel: Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Rachel: All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Rachel: Oh.
Rachel: Okay. So, can I serve you a little ofWhat? What? What? (She seesthat Joshua isnt relaxed.)
Rachel: But, theyre across the hall! I mean thats two doors away, itwould take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Rachel: Okay, yknow, would you feel better if we went someplace else? Imean we could pack all this stuff up and yknow go to your apartment.
Rachel: Your parents?
Rachel: Ohh.
Rachel: Yeah that works.
Rachel: Wow! This place is fabulous!
Rachel: Whoa-whoa, theres two living rooms? God, growing up here, thisplace mustve been a real babe magnet.
Rachel: Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Rachel: That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Rachel: Ah.
Rachel: Hi you!
Rachel: I know, I can do more than cook.
Rachel: Ohh! Its so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes theirhands.) Hello. 
Rachel: Hello.
Rachel: What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this isnotthats-thats not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, seeand-and, this is a real dress actually. Its-its, theyre-theyrewearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how peoplerespond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdales, soAnd obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to reportback, "USA not ready."

Rachel: Well, we were going to do that afterI mean umm, next.
Rachel: Oh, yeah, well Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyinaround the house. 
Rachel: Yes.
Rachel: Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilledwater down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Rachel: No, its all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod thereheads in agreement.)

Rachel: I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hatethe fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Rachel: Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Rachel: Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on thefloor!
Rachel: Im sorry. Im so sorry.
Rachel: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: Let me finish. 
Rachel: Im talking about a bet, winner takes all.

Rachel: All right, cut, lets pick again, pick again.
Rachel: Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queenis high!

Rachel: No, just singing. (Does a little song.)

Rachel: Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous! Imean, theyre gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way,one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thingoff. Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youredancing at theres.

Rachel: Yeah! (She sits down) Sit!
Rachel: Im more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Rachel: Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we areso on the right track! Yknow? I mean, I think we are working, I think we areclicking. Yknow?
Rachel: Yeah-yeah, yknow if-if there was just like one little area whereIthat I think we needwe would need to work on; I-I would think it waswere just not crazy enough!
Rachel: Well, yeah, right, yknow what? Yeah, youre right, I mean, weno, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)I mean, I meanlike craaaazy! Yknow? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna soundyknow, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we gotmarried?
Rachel: Oh, I know, I know, its-its so, its so totally like,"Whoa! Can we do this?" Yknow, I mean, but I mean it just feels right!Dont you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, dont you think?
Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua
Rachel: Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girlwho is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.
Rachel: Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. Ifeel blue.
Rachel: Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care. I dont thinkhes the one Im sad about. Yknow, I know that I said that I am totallyokay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handlingit all that well.
Rachel: And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Rachel: Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, onagain, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be onagain.
Rachel: Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Rachel: Three people. Joshuas not gonna be there.
Rachel: Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Rachel: Well, apparently he scares easy.
Rachel: Its okay. Sometimes, things dont work out the way youdthought they would.
Rachel: (breaking the hug) Oh, hey, dont you have to go pick up Emily?
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Yeah! I got my girls.
Rachel: Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebes lap.)
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Yknow, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Rachel: Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)
Rachel: Im not gonna marry Chandler!
Rachel: Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as shedoes, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that its Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on thedoor.)
Rachel: Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, thatoughta do it.
Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there andthen this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!

Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out.It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater.  Ooh, I just wish wehadnt lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a littleperspective...
Rachel: You seem to really like her.
Rachel: Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monicas photo albums, I mean youdont do that if youre just in it for two weeks.
Rachel: Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, andyoure sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.

Rachel: Oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
Rachel: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I sawthis pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when Iwas a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Rachel: What did you just say?
Rachel: Oh.... my God.
Rachel:  (seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.) Oh my God.
Rachel: Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Rachel:  She didn't hang up either...
Rachel: (on phone) Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um,everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...Iam over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (She hangs upand tosses phone in the ice bucket.)
Rachel: Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phoneRoss, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . (She jumps the couch andlands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expressionon his face.)
Rachel: Ohhhhhhhh God. (climbs off his back)

Rachel: Really?
Rachel: Oh, god.
Rachel: Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Rachel: Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.

Rachel: Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Rachel: Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!
Rachel: Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebes way.)
Rachel: No we
Rachel: hormones, yeah.

Rachel: Good.
Rachel: What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)

Rachel: I dont know!
Rachel: I still dont get how you know when its false labour.
Rachel: Well, isnt that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Rachel: No, really. Really, Pheebs, youre not gonna be the one worryingabout saving for college, or yelling at them when theyre bad, yknow, ordeciding to put them on Ritalin when they just wont calm down. Yknow?
Rachel: And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Rachel: And yknow what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.

Rachel: Because, I cant! Ross, I told you, no. I cant.
Rachel: Oh, honey! Dont get up! What do you need?
Rachel: Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Rachel: Okay, that is all you.
Rachel: Oh, I dont know. I guess we have to eat.
Rachel: Im just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. Ishouldnt have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Rachel: (interrupting) Still in love with?! 
Rachel: Im not in love with Ross!
Rachel: Phoebe, Im going to Rosss wedding because he is myex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, Im still inlove with him! I mean, hey, yknow, I like Ross as much as the next guy, yknow?Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings dont mean love! I mean, I stillhave loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, butthat doesnt mean that-that Im still in love with him. Yknow? I-I havesexual feelings for him, but I do love himOhh! Oh my God! Oh mywhydidnt you tell me?!!
Rachel: We?!
Rachel: You all know? Does Ross know?
Rachel: Oh, I can not believe you didnt tell me!
Rachel: (depressed) Hi.
Rachel: Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Rachel: You can?
Rachel: Um-hmm.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with somegraveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Rachel: I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Rachel: I dont know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much,and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: All right.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Ow!
Rachel: Well, I like you less!
Rachel: Pheebs?
Rachel: Do you remember where the duck food is?
Rachel: (enters with a bag packed) Because Im going to London.
Rachel: Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, youdont have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.) 
Rachel: Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel!He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Rachel: OhhDo you think he will?!
Rachel: Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, "Ido." (Exits)
Rachel: (Running to the ticket counter) Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. (Slightly out ofbreath) Hi.
Rachel: (Faking cheerfulness.) Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
Rachel: Ohh, good.
Rachel: Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Okay, Icouldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming upto me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it wassooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why,because I make very bad decisions.
Rachel: Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Rachel: Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from nowon you make all of my decisions for me.
Rachel: That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Rachel: Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can'tI still can't believeit. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)
Rachel: I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest ofthe pictures)

Rachel: Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda
Rachel: Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

Rachel: Oh, honey that's awful.
Rachel: But, it's not raining.

Rachel: Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is justreally sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I knowthings seem so bad right now.
Rachel: Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for thedropped socks.)

Rachel: Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Rachel: Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what,you're fired.
Rachel: Well (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry andthrows it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close thedoor. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)
Rachel: No.
Rachel: Well, then talk!

Rachel: (laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Rachel: Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that youjust forget that I told you this?
Rachel: The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.

Rachel: Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept youracceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Rachel: Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.

Rachel: Really?
Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Rachel: What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a bigkick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like acrime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: What? YetiI mean Danny?
Rachel: Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'knowif you hadn't looked so. Y'know.
Rachel: (shocked) What?
Rachel: What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Rachel: So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't!Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Rachel: Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Rachel: And stop saying that! I hate that!
Rachel: Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And youare worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open upyour mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Okay. Okay.
Rachel: (entering) Hi!
Rachel: Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Rachel: That yeti is one smooth talker.
Rachel: Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.

Rachel: Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?
Rachel: How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Rachel: Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuffagain. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, Idon't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Rachel: I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.

Rachel: Ohh, great!
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: (laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out,because he wants me to ask him out.
Rachel: That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he'sall ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hintaround for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Rachel: No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still upfor grabs. You follow me?
Rachel: Exactly.
Rachel: Oh, hi Danny.
Rachel: Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
Rachel: Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Rachel: It's a uh, regatta gala.
Rachel: No-no, but I support it.
Rachel: Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?
Rachel: Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he wouldknow I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. Isaid, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Rachel: Ball? There is no ball.
Rachel: Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Rachel: What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Rachel: Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!

Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think youkilled us.
Rachel: Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game whereeveryone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Rachel: Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents gotdivorced again are you?
Rachel: I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Rachel: What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Big Nosed Rachel: Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Big Nosed Rachel: Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip wasgoing to come over
Big Nosed Rachel: Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It reallycreeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy'sthing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! (Walks into the living room and greetsMonica's parents.) Hi!
Big Nosed Rachel: Happy Thanksgiving!
Big Nosed Rachel: Oh! No, not really.
Big Nosed Rachel: Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slutNancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Big Nosed Rachel: Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They arejust silly. (Ross is overhearing this.) Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Big Nosed Rachel: Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slutwas all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Big Nosed Rachel: I know!

Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Okay, that we may be able to do.
Rachel: Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Rachel: Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna evertake it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're justgonna make him think that you are.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Then, you will definitely get him back!
Rachel: Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turnsyou on.
Rachel: Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!(She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good againstmy cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring itdown to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Rachel: Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler)Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)

Rachel: Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this peprally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?
Rachel: Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Rachel: Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which Ithink is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Rachel: Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Rachel: Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that wasreally embarrassing what happened to you!
Rachel: Joey, is what she just said ummOh my God. (Looks around the room.)You were actually gonna (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.)(Rachel stares in shock.)

Rachel: That was not funny!
Rachel: Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to besomething we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
Rachel: Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I justwanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
Rachel: (sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Rachel: You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Rachel: Joey has got a secret peephole!
Rachel: Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us!And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Rachel: Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)
Rachel: Well, what is the truth?
Rachel: Monica, is this true?
Rachel: Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found yourunderwear in our apartment the other day?
Rachel: And the video camera?
Rachel: Oh my god. Ok you guys, theres Danny. Watch. Just watch this.(He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending hes not interested.Ohh, hes coming over. Just pretend like we dont know him. Weve forgottenwho he is.
Rachel: Thanks, Mon.
Rachel: Monica!!!
Rachel: (Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what?Dont answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny.
Rachel: I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his armaround her.
Rachel: Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in ourrelationship!!
Rachel: No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to theplan!
Rachel: She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on thedate. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Rachel: So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
Rachel: You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods,"Yes.") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep onthe couch!
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: (not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continueto ignore her.)
Rachel: (entering from her room) Hey!
Rachel: Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Rachel: Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guyswrestle?
Rachel: Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girlon the subway.
Rachel: Yeah, they were very y'knowwrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Rachel: Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.(She leaves them to wrestle.)
Rachel: Oh, great!
Rachel: Okay, see? I told you!
Rachel: Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
Rachel: Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond,and
Rachel: Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going onhere but let's
Rachel: No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Rachel: No-no, they're not very nice people.
Rachel: Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know itdoes sort of
Rachel: Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)
Rachel: I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Rachel: Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
Rachel: I'm not reading this!
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: So?
Rachel: Oh, good point.
Rachel: (To Joey) Happy New Year, Joey!
Rachel: But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Rachel: Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needingthese to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his deskdrawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Rachel: I don't gossip!
Rachel: Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I passthat information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. Imean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Rachel: What? They were like this! 
Rachel: I didnt! Even when I found outumm, all right, well let'sjust say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keepit. (Goes into her room.)
Rachel: I think they're very nice.
Rachel: Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe andMonica.)
Rachel: (entering, singing) "Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Rachel: Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace aroundwondering what to do.)
Rachel: (entering) Joey, do you have a minute?
Rachel: Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Rachel: Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannottell anyone.
Rachel: Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
Rachel: What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Rachel: I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up thephone (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts hisfingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeingthat Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in hiscurrent state.)
Rachel: That really is something; that's really cool.
Rachel: Good luck, honey!
Rachel: Hey, uh, Joey?
Rachel: Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Rachel: I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would beokay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Rachel: (quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would mind going over toChandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: Do you know something?
Rachel: I might know something too.
Rachel: Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
Rachel: Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Rachel: All right, how about I go over there and I will walk intoChandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actuallythe thing that I think that I know! (Note: Kudos to Ms. Aniston on the delivery of thatline. She said it very quickly and didn't screw up a word. Try it yourself, it ain't thateasy.)
Rachel: AND YOU KNOW!!!
Rachel: Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have youknown?
Joey and Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Ohhh, yeah, me too.
Rachel: Come on Joey!!!
Rachel: I can't believe you would say that!
Rachel: No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on thecouch.) Fine I wantI need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
Rachel: Is he romantic with her?
Rachel: Are they in love?
Rachel: You don't know anything.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that.
Rachel: Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Rachel: (To Monica) Hey!
Rachel: What's up?!
Rachel: Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with myfriend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new withyou?
Rachel: Oh y'know what, we dont have to talk about work. We can talk aboutanything!
Rachel: Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Rachel: Nothing! You go!
Rachel: Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually dohave a lot of work to do so if-ifare you sure there's just not anything else?
Rachel: No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Rachel: Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Rachel: There he is!
Rachel: Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Rachel: You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Rachel: Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Rachel: Ross! Janice?!
Rachel: (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted duringour entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell evenwhen I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
Rachel: Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Rachel: I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll justtell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said,"Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know whatyour nickname is, Mr. Big."
Rachel: Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you andChandler.
Rachel: Sure! Why?
Rachel: What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keepslying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them rightnow!
Rachel: Hey! Hi!
Rachel: Well, I was actuallyI-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm,look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Rachel: That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at mybooks!
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: 'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica andis almost in tears.)
Rachel: Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store?I'll help you out.
Rachel: Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Rachel: Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuffright after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
Rachel: Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs abag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)
Rachel: It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Rachel: No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the springcatalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men, carrying the bag.
Rachel: Exactly! Unisex!
Rachel: No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Rachel: (entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is notuntil tomorrow.
Rachel: Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Rachel: All right, then you owe me $350.
Rachel: (glaring at him) Joey
Rachel: Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Rachel: Hi sweetie!
Rachel: Why?! Why not?!
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you thatpart.
Rachel: Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Rachel: What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Rachel: Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you arewith it (Looks for help.)
Rachel: I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Rachel: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldnthave a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause)controversial.
Rachel: I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Rachel: Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Rachel: Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Rachel: Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly NakedGuy's bathroom. (Does so.)
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Oh my God!
Rachel: OH MY GOD!!!
Rachel: Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Rachel: I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Rachel: Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stopscreaming!!
Phoebe and Rachel: Ohhh!!!

Rachel: Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get thisapartment!
Rachel: Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Rachel: Joey! Come here! Come here!
Rachel: Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Rachel: No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and wesaw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up againstthe window.
Rachel: Wh-what do you mean?
Rachel: Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Rachel: Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.

Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Rachel: Oh.

Rachel: Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Rachel: Oh.
Rachel: What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you theapartment?
Rachel: All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Rachel: Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Rachel: Y'know what you should do?
Rachel: You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond withhim. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, ormy underwear.
Rachel: (To Ross) See?
Rachel: Yeah, he broke those too.
Rachel: Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (ToPhoebe) It's Chandler.
Rachel: Are you kidding?!
Rachel: I can not believe he would do that to MonWhoa! (She stops suddenlyand slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that weknow?
Rachel: Joey!
Rachel: Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Rachel: All right. Be sexy.
Rachel: Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monicacovers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler'sshoulder.)
Rachel: Show time!
Rachel: Okay! (She runs to get some.)
Rachel: (handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen fromright here!
Rachel: Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)
Rachel: Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.) 
Rachel: Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandlerthe sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Rachel: Okay!
Rachel: (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what'sgoing on?!
Rachel: Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Rachel: Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were goingto react.
Rachel: Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
Rachel: Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this mustbe really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Rachel: Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't youjust pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Rachel: Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Rachel: And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Rachel: Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probablyalready in Monica's head.
Rachel: Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Rachel: Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you alreadyknow! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she'sa woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Rachel: No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, thatmakes everything different.
Rachel: Not unless different means the same.
Rachel: Hi! Wow! You look, you lookbig.
Rachel: Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Rachel: Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Rachel: Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, "You see what I mean?!")
Rachel: Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you arethe one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)
Rachel: Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)
Rachel: Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)
Rachel: Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)
Rachel: Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them tomove in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Rachel: (looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip.
Rachel: A couple of bucks.
Rachel: Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Rachel: Hey Joey!
Rachel: (disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!
Rachel: What?! You say that to kids?!!
Rachel: Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
Rachel: Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Rachel: Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expectingher to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?
Rachel: (Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to heramazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Rachel: Ross!
Rachel: Ross!
Rachel: Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying avery heavy couch.
Rachel: (To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.
Rachel: Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Rachel: Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Rachel: Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Oh-oh! 
Rachel: Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Rachel: (entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Rachel: (noticing him) What's up Joey?
Rachel: Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Rachel: Thanks!
Rachel: I know.
Rachel: What's up Joe?
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: (laughing) What are you saying?
Rachel: Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw mefirst, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
Rachel: (laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, y'know umm Nohoney, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before youdate them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend,build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Rachel: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Rachel: (entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Rachel: Well, I brought the next best thing.
Rachel: Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)
Rachel: Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Rachel: Okay!
Rachel: Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Chandler and Rachel: You think?!
Rachel: I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Rachel: Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Rachel: What?! Why?!
Rachel: Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Rachel: Good, you guys are all here!
Rachel: Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Rachel: I know!
Rachel: Wh-what?!
Rachel: Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'llwork right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: O-okay!
Rachel: Hi. 
Rachel: Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Rachel: No!
Rachel: Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? Ieven made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! Ifyou've got enough life jackets!" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are notamused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-byeand ugh!
Rachel: (We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, wewere shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me Y'know maybe he was going to openthe door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh (The flashback shows that shekissed him on the cheek.)
Rachel: Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Rachel: Thanks Chandler.
Rachel: I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Rachel: What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Rachel: I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me backy'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Rachel: Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would justsleep with him?
Rachel: Maybe. I-I don't knowOh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Rachel: Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Thank you.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Excuse me?
Rachel: (stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's goingon here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am notsome hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries tointerrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that doesnot give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job thatbad. Good day, sir. (She storms out of his office.)
Rachel: (entering) Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from RalphLauren did too me!
Rachel: Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Rachel: Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh.
Rachel: Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Rachel: (looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like tostart by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Rachel: Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (Sheputs her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to puther hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a bigmistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage.When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity.And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizesthat she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know yougotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances inthe workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want tolitigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.  Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (countsthem off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, andnot litigious. Look Mr
Rachel: Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think,I think I would be really good at it.
Rachel: (gasps) Oh! You are?
Rachel: Really? Oh thank you! Oh Oh, would it be completely inappropriateto give you a hug?
Rachel: Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand butmisses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean totouch thatI mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm goingto leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you soHey! I'll see you Monday!(Exits.)
Rachel: (laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Rachel: Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. 
Rachel: (entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Rachel: Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on myvery first day
Rachel: Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Rachel: Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (Onthe other one.) Sorry.
Rachel: (laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.
Rachel: Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horrorstories(stops and tries to change directions)about ghosts and goblins whototally supported the princess's right to smoke.
Rachel: and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of thedecisions without me!
Rachel: I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting,poisoning habit!
Rachel: I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outsidesmoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupidclean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who doyou think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Rachel: Yeah, I can do that.
Rachel: I would love to!
Rachel: Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come outhere and get some fresh air.
Rachel: Oh great!
Rachel: Oh that's okay.
Rachel: Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'knowwhat, actually (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kimare standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
Rachel: Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what Imean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys arecrazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
Rachel: Oh, me too.
Rachel: (Laughs) Oh, me too.
Rachel: Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said,y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Rachel: Thanks!
Rachel: Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.This is actually the smell of success.
Rachel: I did not!
Rachel: All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Rachel: No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels alittle fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Rachel: I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)
Rachel: Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back,y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach.
Rachel: Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Rachel: Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! Wecan get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Rachel: Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs theircigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)
Rachel: Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim'slighter.)
Rachel: Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Rachel: Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Rachel: Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at leasttold me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
Rachel: Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Rachel: Okay. (Starts to walk away.)
Rachel: (hearing that) Oh man!
Rachel: What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Rachel: Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I meanChandler's birthday is even before mine!
Rachel: Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Rachel: Oh, okay, not so weird.
Rachel: I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law &amp;Order!
Rachel: No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Rachel: What's going on?
Rachel: Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then.I think it's okay that we see other people.
Rachel: Hm-mmm.
Rachel: Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements. 
Rachel: Big night!
Rachel: Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to herroom.)
Rachel: (She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!
Rachel: Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. Iknow it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Rachel: Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Rachel: Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrowher stuff!
Rachel: Because I lose her stuff!
Rachel: Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Rachel: Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Rachel: Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Rachel: But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was neververy good at the flirting thing.
Rachel: Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamnnine years later you had me!
Rachel: Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Rachel: Okay that is the one we already have!
Rachel: (smiling) What?!
Rachel: (smiling) Yeah.
Rachel: (smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not yourfault.
Rachel: It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler'slast night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)
Rachel: Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Rachel: (entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!
Rachel: The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I'vebeen looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)
Rachel: Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)
Rachel: I don't know, I don't know.
Rachel: Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
Rachel: Ohh that'd be great!
Rachel: Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listenhoney, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it.I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)
Rachel: Your sunglasses?!
Rachel: Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, Idon't flirting is the right thing to (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)
Rachel: I'm sorry.
Rachel: Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a coupleof the old pizza boxes and exits.)
Rachel: Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs?The ones with all the pizza?
Rachel: No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actuallyumm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get pastthat part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Rachel: Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny andhe's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Rachel: Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Rachel: (entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-anduh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Rachel: Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.(Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)
Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Rachel: Yay!
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Rachel: Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Rachel: Great! Thanks!
Rachel: Okay. 
Rachel: Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Rachel: Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fixyou a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Rachel: No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, youget all the margarita stuff ready.
Rachel: Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please!Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at thestand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it andfinds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phonerings.)
Rachel: Hey! What's up?!
Rachel: So all we have is ice?
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)
Rachel: (does Monica's) I know!
Rachel: What?! We can't do that!
Rachel: Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I knowthat! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesnt give us the rightto erase his message!
Rachel: I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Rachel: Ugh!
Rachel: Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset!I mean, listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)
Rachel: Noooooooo!
Rachel: No, wait. Wait.
Rachel: No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Rachel: Yeah well unless we tell him.
Rachel: Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Rachel: Right?
Rachel: Hey! Hi!
Rachel: Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay?This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Rachel: Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Rachel: What?! What? What happened?!
Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: (gasps) Really?!
Rachel: Because a car backfired?
Rachel: Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing"thing but um, Emily called you today.
Rachel: No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) Butit-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.
Rachel: Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding anddid you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Rachel: Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Rachel: Okay. Thank you! Thank you! BecauseI'm sorry, all right. Becausey'know what? She didn't want menot important. The point is, I was right. Yourdecision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision.
Rachel: Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right,no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you reallywant to get back into that?
Rachel: Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barelyan experience!
Rachel: Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this isabout escaping stuff.
Rachel: I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death,y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together withEmily?
Rachel: Well, there you go!
Rachel: (laughing) Close call day.
Rachel: Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)
Rachel: Oh?
Rachel: No. (She heads for the door again.)
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: (going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps,right?
Rachel: (entering) Hey, you guys
Rachel: Is Monica here?
Rachel: All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonnalike it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since Iwas a little girl.
Rachel: Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready? 
Rachel: Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Rossstares in shock.) Check it out!
Rachel: It's a, it's a cat!
Rachel: Yes it is!
Rachel: Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Rachel: Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Rachel: A thousand bucks.
Rachel: All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was alittle girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lapand purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Rachel: Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't carewhat you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They bothglare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: Well, it's my cat.
Rachel: Oh yeah, I got a cat.
Rachel: You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean,it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and itjust flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy,but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Rachel: Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Rachel: (she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, Idon't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Rachel: I tried! They won't take her back.
Rachel: Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean,what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Rachel: No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm allscratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)
Rachel: Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)
Rachel: It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Rachel: Oh no! No! It's actuallyit's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!(Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?
Rachel: Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! Allright? Move on!
Rachel: Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Rachel: Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Rachel: Okay, a thousand.
Rachel: Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as moreof an investment than a cat.
Rachel: (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously youknow how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't callthe cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leavethe money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled)Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at heragain, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Rachel: It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs.Whiskerson.
Rachel: Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Rachel: Oh yeah, there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)
Rachel: Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)
Rachel: Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Rachel: Phoebe, are you okay?
Rachel: Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
Rachel: Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Rachel: No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)
Rachel: Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Rachel: Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Rachel: Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
Rachel: (flinches) Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weirdthing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Rachel: (flinches again) Monica! Come on!
Rachel: (freaks) Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Rachel: Chandler!
Rachel: Just stop it! Come on!
Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh!(She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purposeknocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking throughthe mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the boxand dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh, I mean, look atthis mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have toreschedule!
Rachel: Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Rachel: All right, I'm outta here!
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: So were done then!
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: (jerks back from the tester) What?!
Rachel: All right.
Rachel: I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her headback.) Okay.
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Okay. Okay!
Rachel: (really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow!Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look atpeople's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her toflinch and scream at him.)
Rachel: Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Rachel: Great!
Rachel: Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)
Rachel: Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a100% better.
Rachel: Damn!
Rachel: Bye you guys!
Rachel: Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind thepuss.
Rachel: Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runsafter him.)
Rachel: Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when hestarts to lose.
Rachel: Eh! Stop it!
Rachel: Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The onlyproblem is, it's not over her eye.)
Rachel: Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Rachel: All right!
Rachel: All right.
Rachel: Yes!
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Okay, they are. (No they're not.)
Rachel: (thinks) Four.
Rachel: Really?!
Rachel: Okay!
Rachel: Great!
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Well, well, you said it was practice!
Rachel: Because I knew you were lying!
Rachel: (as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God!Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)
Rachel: Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Rachel: Monica! Stop it!
Rachel: Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make afortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqué pose,at least for primetime TV.)
Rachel: Yep!
Rachel: What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Rachel: Oh! (She's trying to recover while still on the floor.)
Rachel: Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Rachel: No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that Iwant to talk to are right here.
Rachel: (under her breath) Sucker!
Rachel: (entering with Ross) Hi!
Rachel: Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Rachel: Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can'tmiss that.
Rachel: That sounds great.
Rachel: Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myselffor a night.
Rachel: No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Rachel: No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk aroundnaked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Rachel: (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes upguys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these Iwish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In herhead.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchennaked! I'm picking up an orange. (Doesso) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, andcarefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her bodyaway.)
Rachel: (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!(There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes toanswer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looksthrough the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who'sleaning against the door jam.) 
Rachel: Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Rachel: Yeah, sure?
Rachel: And um, what-what is that Ross?
Rachel: (laughs) What?! Are you crazy?
Rachel: (gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
Rachel: Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex withyou?!
Rachel: Ohh wow! Im sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Rachel: Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Rachel: Yes.
Rachel: Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle thequestion of "us?"
Rachel: (taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'mgoing to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is notan invitation to the physical act of love.
Rachel: I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Rachel: No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Rachel: Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass thateasily.
Rachel: No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Rachel: Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just reallylikes you.
Rachel: (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only secondsafter Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn'treal, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pantswould be dry.) Hi! 
Rachel: Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems tohave had a little accident.
Rachel: Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks)
Rachel: Ahh.
Rachel: Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parentsdrag him off.) Ohh, kids love me.
Rachel: Hi! (Hugs Phoebe)
Rachel: Pancho Vila?
Rachel: What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I don't(She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God, you drewon me?!
Rachel: Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! Icanyou have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)
Rachel: (returning with her purse covering her face) All right, it won'tcome off!
Rachel: It won't come off!
Rachel: No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Rachel: Hi!!
Rachel: Hi. (She hugs Joey.)
Rachel: What?! What else did he say?
Rachel: Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking likethis!
Rachel: Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Rachel: Okay, I need a, I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)
Rachel: (she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.)Macadamia nut?
Rachel: Hm-mmm! (Opens the container)
Rachel: Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again inanother direction.)
Rachel: Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
Rachel: Hit me!
Rachel: I bet 20.
Rachel: Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hitme. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down witheach one.)
Rachel: Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. (Gets up butstumbles a little bit.) Whup, okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up, withoutdialing.) Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? Wewould like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Rachel: Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! (Goes and hugs Joey.)
Rachel: Hey!

Rachel: Ohhh!!
Rachel: Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Rachel: Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
Rachel: Good luck to ya!
Rachel: Wow!
Rachel: (bowing) Hello!
Ross and Rachel: (bowing) Hello!
Rachel: Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)
Rachel: Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!
Rachel: Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)
Rachel: Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!
Rachel: Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache andgroans.)
Rachel: I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Rachel: Really?!
Rachel: Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Rachel: Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt doanything stupid.
Rachel: (To Ross) I dont know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night?Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Rachel: (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
Rachel: No, we didnt get married! Thats ridiculous!
Rachel: Oh my God.
Rachel: No!
Rachel: Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)
Rachel: Hey, hubby!
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Rachel: Okay! So, well just stay married.
Rachel: And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Rachel: Okay, see now Im scared because I dont actually thinkyoure kidding.
Rachel: What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!
Rachel: Ohh, okay, Im sorry. Youre right. Yknow what? Weabsolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far awayfrom each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about whatyoure asking of me.
Rachel: You are asking me to be your wife!
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look Ithought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not staymarried.
Rachel: Oh b-b-but it is!
Rachel: Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is theworlds worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, Iwill!
Rachel: Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there anysuch thing as an annulment shower?
Rachel: Huh, thats funny. You look like youre gonna be the

Rachel: I havent seen it yet!
Rachel: Noooooooo!!
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Ugh, the worse day! Yknow, you think youre making progressat work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Rachel: I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so ofcourse no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the endof the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Oh my God! Thats so great! Im so happy for you guys! 
Rachel: And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us aregonna have such a good time living together!
Rachel: And Chandler, youre gonna have to watch those long showers youtake in the morning because you know Raquel cant be late.
Rachel: Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God (Gasps and starts to sing)Come and knock on my door
Rachel: (entering) Hey roomie!
Rachel: (gasps) Are you pregnant?!
Rachel: Um-hmm.
Rachel: (laughs) Oh my God! Oh, thats funny, I cant believe I didthat.
Rachel: Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)
Rachel: Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.
Rachel: Monica, where did you get these?!
Rachel: Ooh, good God, theyre so yummy! (She re-ingests the previouslyexpelled cookie matter from the tissue.)
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Okay!
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?
Rachel: Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Rachel: Mon, honey youre not dying. Im just moving out. Yknow,I mean were gonna see each other all the time.
Rachel: Are you okay? Youre not blinking.
Rachel: Oh, all right. But yknow I gotta say, I dont, I dontthink six years counts as an era.
Rachel: What is the matter with you?!
Rachel: All right, fine, but dont get mad at me. Its-its justa little hard to believe.
Rachel: Well yknow, its you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff!Yknow? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! Iguess Im not upset because I dont see you guys going through with it. Imsorry.
Rachel: But I
Rachel: It is? Really?
Rachel: (starting to lose her composure) I mean were not, were notgonna live together anymore?
Rachel: What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)
Rachel: I mean its the end of an era!
Rachel: Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out andeverything is changing.
Rachel: Thank you.
Rachel: (entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
Rachel: Well since Im movin out and-and youre sobeautiful
Rachel: how about I move in with you?
Rachel: You have a roommate?!
Rachel: Oh, thats true.
Rachel: Yeah, yeah I think Im gonna find my own place.
Rachel: Pheebs, I have to ask you
Rachel: Youre just staring into space.
Rachel: This one? (Picks it up.)
Rachel: Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place Ican afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one andstarts to read it.) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Itsjust, there is nothing! The citys full!
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Yeah! Why?
Rachel: That sounds great! Id love to live at Warrens!! I loveWarren! Thank you!
Rachel: Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thankyou! 
Rachel: (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is alreadysubletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. Im never gonna find anything.
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Rachel: I would love to live with you Ross; thats-thats great! Thankyou!
Rachel: Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I wasgonna be homeless. You just saved me! Youre my hero!
Rachel: Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisseshim on the cheek and exits.) 
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandlerhad a big fight and theyre not moving in.
Rachel: No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Rachel: Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psychedcause I dont have to move in here!
Rachel: No-no, Im staying put.
Rachel: Why, where are you going?
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Oh wow.
Rachel: Yeah. Yknow umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I reallyappreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but dont you think itsgonna be weird?
Rachel: Well, because of us! Because of our history.
Rachel: No?
Rachel: No! Not at all!
Rachel: Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Rachel: Yeah! Im gonna have a boyfriend, youre gonna have agirlfriend
Rachel: But yknow what, if you think its gonna be okay welljust work out a system. Yknow, itll be like college, Ill hang a hangeron the door and put a sign, "Come back later, Im gettin lucky."(Laughs.)
Rachel: Umm, well lets see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Rachel: No, the other thing. I really think its great they work thingsout.
Rachel: Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the streetand make a copy?
Rachel: Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy,theres no turning back.
Rachel: All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.
Rachel: Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait aminute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays.
Rachel: So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Rachel: And?
Rachel: Look at that!
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: No-no, I bought those.
Rachel: Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)
Rachel: Well, who wouldnt?!
Rachel: And Mrs.?!
Rachel: What?!!
Rachel: Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.) 
Rachel: Yeah honey you dont believe her do you?
Rachel: Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Rachel: Some uh, some visual aides.
Rachel: Hey Pheebs, youre still alive! How are you doing?
Rachel: Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
Rachel: Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought wed lost youforever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Rachel: Monica!
Rachel: Did-did you take these back?
Rachel: Oh yeah, theyre really great! Arent they?
Rachel: Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Wow, thats great Ross, Im sorry we werent moresupportive before.
Rachel: Well, were a little early, the lecture doesnt end for 15minutes.
Rachel: Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! Theres some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I wasa Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches.
Rachel: Yeah, and not a very good one.

Rachel: You stole them from me!!
Rachel: Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Rachel: Well
Rachel: Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean theyreprobably not even listening!
Rachel: Of course theyre listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Rachel: Really? Really?!
Rachel: Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent)"Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, wed like youto come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)
Rachel: Hey!

Rachel: I cannot believe that you didnt tell me that we are stillmarried!!

Rachel: So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Rosss, andI have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
Rachel: Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Rachel: Well theres an idea!!
Rachel: That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Rachel: December 26th, huh maybe shes Santa Clause.
Rachel: (deadpan) Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Rachel: Well sure, if you say youre gonna take care of everything I haveno reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right, nowIm gonna do this my way and I dont want to hear a peep out of you!
Rachel: Op! Youre peeping!
Rachel: Ross! Yknow what, I just gotwhy? Why did you do this?!
Rachel: I dont wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Rachel: Well, yknow what? Thanks to you Im half way there! Ugh! Oh!I am so mad! Ross, I dont think I have ever been this angry!
Rachel: Ugh! (Stares at him.)
Rachel: Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Rachel: Uh yes, heroin and crack.
Rachel: Well, you would know.
Rachel: (starts to cry) Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Rachel: Ugh!
Rachel: Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!(To the stenographer) And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from therecord?
Rachel: Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Rachel: (stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated likebunnies nonsense!
Rachel: (to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what youre keeping memarried too?!
Rachel: All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and Iam not leaving here until I get one!
Rachel: And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.)
Rachel: This is totally your fault!
Rachel: Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!!
Rachel: Dont call us that! (Storms away)
Rachel: (deadpan) Oh honey thank God youre home, I was getting worried.
Rachel: Oh, little Xs! Great! That makes up for everything!
Rachel: Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Rachel: Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I wasin love with you!
Rachel: Nothing. (Sits down.)
Rachel: Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each pageout of the way.)
Rachel: Okay Ross, werewait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have alittle confession.
Rachel: Well, yknow this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Rachel: Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night wewere married?
Rachel: And uh, yeah, I didnt really, I didnt want to say anything,but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in thecasino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and Ithought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided firstto get married, and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got usinto this mess.
Rachel: Yeah, dont push it though.
Rachel: I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the onethat stuck. And it wouldnt be a secret, and we wouldnt have our wedding dinnerat Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)
Rachel: No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Rachel: Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Rachel: Im gonna need a copy of those.
Rachel: (entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wondering
Rachel: Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Rachel: Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe heropinion on what I should wear tonight.
Rachel: Yeah, yeah, I know.
Rachel: Surprise!!
Rachel: No, no dont get mad because lookthis is what happened. SoI-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!"Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
Rachel: Ohhhhhh, look its the roller blades.
Rachel: You remember when we got these?
Rachel: I guess you werent there. (They hug.)
Rachel: Im sorry Pheebs, I guess Im just really said that Imleaving.
Rachel: I have one.
Rachel: Uh well, I guess Im not gonna miss the fact that youre neverallowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)
Rachel: You get your messages!
Rachel: So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler?Or your mom?
Rachel: Ooh, your brother. Score!
Rachel: You know what else Im not gonna miss? "Im Monica. Iwash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Rachel: "Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interestingpeople. Ever!"
Rachel: "Oh my God, I cant find a boyfriend! So I guess Illjust stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
Rachel: Im unpacking!
Rachel: Im not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is thatpicture straight?
Rachel: Hey, yknow what? Youre the one who wants to make this bigchange and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have toleave?!
Rachel: Well its mine too! What else you got?!
Rachel: Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks overMonica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)
Rachel: Great! Monicas moving!
Rachel: Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica startschasing Rachel around the table.)
Rachel: Yeah, Im just mad!
Rachel: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that onChandler.
Monica and Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Well, Phoebe thats fine because Im not moving.
Rachel: Oh really? Like what Monica?
Rachel: Oh yeah, good start Mon.
Rachel: Yeah and you stretch em out with your big old clown feet.
Rachel: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Rachel: Well yknow, I dont want you to be cold.
Rachel: Oh, its gonna be fine.
Rachel: But honey, I think shes moving in with Chandler.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Oh God! This is silly, Im gonna see you in a couple of hours!(They hug again.) 
Rachel: Bye house!
Rachel: Bye Mon.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Hi...
Rachel: Rachel...
Rachel: Phoebes...
Rachel: leave...
Rachel: Wait, I-I just said "leave." 
Rachel: Phoebe, come on that's silly.
Rachel: No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Everybody
Rachel: Rachel
Rachel: Phoebes
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go runningbefore it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Rachel: Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our firstyknow roommate bonding thing.
Rachel: Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Rachel: OK!
Rachel: Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Rachel: Okay. (Runs off.)
Rachel: You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross betweenKermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Rachel: Oh! I used to do that too!
Rachel: Aw, Mon...(Kisses her on the cheek)
Rachel: Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I justdon't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Rachel: You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Rachel: Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Rachel: Ankle.
Rachel: No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually justchecking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Rachel: No, wait Phoebe.
Rachel: Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Rachel: Okay, um, I...(Phoebe walks into her room.) All right Phoebe look, Ijust wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should nothave lied to you. 
Rachel: Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Rachel: Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is becauseum, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)
Rachel: Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Rachel: Because they're people.
Rachel: Yes, but still. They're peoplewith eyes.
Rachel: I-I am not uptightHey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight,man.
Rachel: (Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!
Rachel: Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
Rachel: Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turnsand bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runsoff.)
Rachel: Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Well, sure, but they might think its kinda weird considering Idont work there anymore.
Rachel: I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Rachel: Yeah. (chuckling) A year ago..
Rachel: But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But,just come by at lunch so my boss doesnt see you. Cause Kim will just freak out andshe already doesnt like me very much.
Rachel: Sure.
Rachel: Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Rachel: What? What!?! You kissed him?
Rachel: (Gasps) Phoebe are you serious?
Rachel: Phoebe, I mean, you do know hes married?
Rachel: Phoebe
Rachel: Oh, Kim, Hi. (Kim doesnt even look up from her report.)
Rachel: So you know, II handed in that marketing report and I never got tohear what you thought.
Rachel: Ahh.SoWowThe spring line, its really going to begreat this year, huh?
Rachel: So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.(Kim stops the elevator and turns to Rachel.)
Rachel: Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. (Sitting down on thecouch.) You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Rachel: Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they justmade out. Andthe craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said itwas the best gossip shed heard all year.
Rachel: That-that is your make out buddy. Dont you recognize him? (Holding upthe magazine in front of her face.) Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Oh My God, Phoebe, thats not Ralph Lauren. Thats Kenny the copyguy.
Rachel: Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. Ifshe finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Rachel: To get you to make out with him!!!
Rachel: Ohh, hi, Kim.
Rachel: Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well itdidnt happen.
Rachel: Okay, two things didnt happen. Remember I told you that someone madeout with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out thats not true.
Rachel: No.
Rachel: Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Rachel: I-I dont want your job. I-I dont. Ohh this is such a mistake. Idid not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. Idont even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)
Rachel: Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Rachel: I did but she doesnt think anyone would be stupid enough to confuseKenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Rachel: You were with Kenny today, werent you?
Rachel: Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Rachel: Im not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but Iwouldnt.
Rachel: That wouldnt help me.
Rachel: Kim, hi.
Rachel: Okay..Okay.. Look. Im sorry that I lied to you before. You wereright. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Rachel: (Faking crying.) Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I cant dothis. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I cant do this.Im married and Im sorry." And then I dont know why but he said,"and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog inthe Ralph Lauren machine."
Rachel: Of course its true and it hurts so bad.
Rachel: You and Ralph?
Rachel: Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen tomake a traditional English truffle!
Rachel: (worried) Nothing?
Rachel: So, if-if I mess this up, theres nothing else for dessert?
Rachel: Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you.Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butters done?
Rachel: Her dancer friends?
Rachel: Really?!
Rachel: I dunno. Yknow to me hell always be Jack Geller, walksin while youre changing.
Rachel: (looking at her truffle) Look at it, isnt it beautiful?
Rachel: Its a truffle. Its got all of these layers. Firsttheres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made fromscratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, thenbeef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.] thena little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Rachel: The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, yknow, Ithought well, theres mincemeat pie, I mean thats an Englishdessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, yknow. [To Joey]Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
Rachel: (teasingly) And while Im gone dont you boys sneaka taste.
Rachel: Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Rachel: No!
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: (sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because its soromantic.
Rachel: Joey! Come on! I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright? This isthe only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember thatThanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?
Rachel: So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and youjust worry about eating it, alright?
Rachel: Okay...
Rachel: Whats up, Ross?
Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: Oh no. No Ross, dont do this.
Rachel: I just- I dont think us getting back together is a good idea.
Rachel: I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can berough. Yknow? And its probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
Rachel: No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean youre [pity-tone] alone,alone. And I just-its just not the time for us. Im sorry.
Rachel: Joey, youre gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? Youdont get any dessert.
Rachel: No, Im just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody,its trifle time!
Rachel: It sure is.
Rachel: Beef.
Rachel: Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Rachel: Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take abite with all the layers!
Rachel: Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Rachel: Well?
Rachel: Really? How good? 
Rachel: Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let metry it.
Rachel: ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and,and then just dropped it on the street?
Rachel: Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Rachel: (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Rachel: (reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) Iwasnt supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Rachel: You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe thatyou ate that so that I wouldnt feel bad!
Rachel: Thats a good story, Grandpa.
Rachel: So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling thisstory.
Rachel: Well, I used to date him, but youre still going out with her!
Rachel: Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, Im sorry,but I dont think that was a romantic thing.
Rachel: Well, thats a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in HighSchool, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Rachel: Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Rachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Rachel: Dont worry, were just gonna search here for an hour, themwere gonna go over to Joeys and search, OK?
Rachel: Chandler, arent you worried about what to get Monica forChristmas?
Rachel: Chandler, thats not enough. I mean what if she gets you a greatpresent, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And youve just gottenher one great present? I mean thats just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you dothat to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Rachel: Thats right!
Rachel: Oh, its a Macys bag!
Rachel: (Reading) Dear losers, do you really think Id hidepresents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew theyd break you.
Rachel: We are so gonna find them this year.
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe and Rachel: No, we never do that
Rachel: Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind somecoats.
Rachel: Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Rachel: Ha!
Rachel: Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice ofyou that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Rachel: Hey, this is hollow.
Rachel: This bench, its hollow! I cant believe I never knew that!(She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!
Rachel: Oh, this ones for me!
Rachel: Ooh, lets open them!
Phoebe and Rachel: Why?
Rachel: Whatever Linus, Im opening mine.
Rachel: Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine fromeighth grade?
Rachel: Cos I was gonna say theres no way you couldve done theend the way you guys did it back then!
Rachel: Yeah. Dont do this to yourself.
Rachel: I know.
Rachel: Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holdsthe rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.
Rachel: Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Showsher the picture.)
Rachel: Yeah! Its an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what anapothecary is?
Rachel: Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Rachel: Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the wayfrom the White Plains store.
Rachel: Okay fine! Ill-Ill just tell her its an antiqueapothecary table, she doesnt have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at thislittle drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Guess!
Rachel: Ha! See, I knew, I knew youd get it on the first guess. Isntit cool! Its an apothecary table.
Rachel: Ohh, yes.
Rachel: Almost.
Rachel: It was only 500 bucks.
Rachel: Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it wasnew, yknow like back then.
Rachel: Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was yknow, it waslike a dollar.
Rachel: And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Uh, its from yore. Like the days of yore. Yknow?
Rachel: Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Rachel: Hey! Were here!
Rachel: (seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!
Rachel: Oh no!
Rachel: Ross! Phoebes gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Rachel: I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your tableshes gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Rachel: Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Rachel: I know! I know, she says its all mass-produced, nothing isauthentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So comeon, shes gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?!Please?
Rachel: Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Rachel: Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you.
Rachel: Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of akind.
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights andwell just watch the movie!
Rachel: He got it a flea market!
Rachel: Thats funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Rosss table.)
Rachel: Ohh!!
Rachel: Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact sameapothecary table they have.) 
Rachel: Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of ourantique!
Rachel: Oh yes.
Rachel: see I cant decide whether it would go better next to the newwicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Rachel: I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonialtimes.
Rachel: Well theres yore. And uh, yknow, yesteryear.
Rachel: Oh honey he doesnt need my help.
Rachel: (not sure of what to do) Yknow what? I dont, I dontthink Phoebe really wants to come.
Rachel: Oh, she does want to.
Rachel: Pheebs, I dont know what to say. I guess the flea market was justbetter last time.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Yeah, yknow what? Dont look at it. (Realizes the display istheir living room) Seriously, dont look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)
Rachel: Ugh, those bastards! Lets go.
Rachel: No! No! No! No its not! No its not! Come on! Phoebe, ours istotally different! I mean we dont have the (Looks desperately for somethingdifferent.) We dont have thethat lamp! And-and that screen is yknow, onthe other side.
Rachel: Okay! Okay-okay lookno I did, I just wanted this stuff and I knowhow you feel about Pottery Barn. Just Come on dont be mad.
Rachel: Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Rachel: What?! No! Im not gonna move out!
Rachel: (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Rachel: Thats right!
Rachel: Im sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one isfunny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)
Rachel: We are looking at a Playboy.
Rachel: Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she haslost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, Where arethey, where are they?
Rachel: You see, now, I would date this girl. Shes cute, shesoutdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, thats got to come inhandy
Rachel: (thinks) I dont know.
Phoebe and Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Monica, what are you doing?
Rachel: (To Monica) Well, people are different.
Rachel: What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that Im a pushover?Im not a pushover.
Rachel: Oh my  you think Im a pushover. Well wait, watch this, youknow what? Youre not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I thinkthats pretty strong, thats what I think. Come on, Monica, lets go tolunch. (She leaves)
Rachel: I cannot believe her.
Rachel: Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
Rachel: All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Rachel: No.
Rachel: Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there.
Rachel: Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Rachel: Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can passon my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at thecoffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a longway. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Rachel: Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Rachel: Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Rachel: So, what, youre just, youre just okay with being flaky?
Rachel: Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
Rachel: I am not a pushover!
Monica and Rachel: You did!
Rachel: Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think Ive everheard.
Rachel: How-how did you lose your job here?
Rachel: He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and leftyou in charge when youve been working here two days? Thats not, thatsnot right.
Rachel: Joey, you cant let him get away with that. Ya know what, Imnot going to let him get away with that. Im going to say something to himNo, Ireally shouldnt say anythingNo, I should say something to him. (Goes to thecounter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that youhave to fire him
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Thats right, he can have his job back. Im glad we got thatall straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
Rachel: Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now whos a pushover?
Rachel: Oh, Im sorry. (Gets up and moves.)
Rachel: Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
Rachel: Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of theother two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
Rachel: Wait a minute, youre only giving free stuff away to the prettygirls?
Rachel: Honey, no one thinks youre a pansy, but we do think you need atissue. (She notices something hanging from Monicas nose, as does Joey.)
Rachel: Oh my God, Jill!
Rachel: This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
Rachel: And you know Monica and Ross!
Rachel: And thats Phoebe (points), and thats Joey.
Rachel: Dont!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey, what are youdoing here?!
Rachel: Wow! What did he say?
Rachel: Oh! Did you hear that?! My dads proud of me! My dads proudof me.
Rachel: Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut youoff?
Rachel: Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that couldve everhappened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I didit, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! Im the only daughter dad isproud of! Okay, well this is, this is what youre gonna do. Youre gonna get ajob, youre gonna get an apartment, and then Ill help you and you can stay withus. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?

Rachel: Oh my God Ross! What in heavens name are you doing here?
Rachel: Good. Although yknow, he-hes a private guy. Yknow, Iwish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Rachel: So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang hishead against a table?
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: (To Phoebe) Okay.

Rachel: No Paul, I dont know anything about you! Yknow, like-likeyour childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Rachel: Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, thats always a painfultime! Yknow your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your handin warm water while youre sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.

Rachel: Whats the other one?

Rachel: I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. Allright, this is what were gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, andwe are just gonna let them buy it, and then youre just gonna pay the difference.
Rachel: Okay.

Rachel: Im so happy and not at all jealous.
Rachel: I mean Im probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I meanwhats 2%? Thats nothing.
Rachel: Yeah me too.
Rachel: (staring at him) Whno, but yknow who did stop in herelooking for ya, Tennille.
Rachel: Were gonna find love!
Rachel: Yeah, Im pretty confident about that. Thats what makes it soeasy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a littleguarantee though.
Rachel: Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neitherof them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.
Rachel: Exactly!
Rachel: You do?
Rachel: Who?
Rachel: Joey?!
Rachel: Are you serious?!
Rachel: Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre40, youre gonna marry Joey.

Rachel: Hey you!
Rachel: Oh thank you. Hey yknow, Im so sorry to hear about you andElizabeth.
Rachel: Yeah, love. Its a tricky business isnt it?
Rachel: So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by thetime were 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, andweve-weve already slept together so yknow therell be no surprisesthere! You know what I mean? No like, "Whats that?!"

Rachel: Honey I swear it we just kissed. 
Rachel: Okay come on Phoebe, its nothing! Monica, come on!
Rachel: No!
Rachel: No-no, its really not huge.
Rachel: Joey, you are not! Youre 31.
Rachel: Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: What do you think Monica mean when she said she didnt want totalk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out therekissing.
Rachel: Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?(Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!
Rachel: I care!
Rachel: Yknow what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just getchanged?
Rachel: Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Rachel: Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want totalk to anyone, especially me?
Rachel: No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Monica, what are you talking about?
Rachel: Monica, yknow what? The only reason I did that was because yourparty was so boring!
Rachel: Oh!! 
Rachel: Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Rachel: Ugh, Monica I dont want to steal your stupid thunder!
Rachel: All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it aint gonnahappen!
Rachel: I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Rachel: (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away fromyour night?
Rachel: Oh wow. Thatyknow what? That is so unfair. Yknow what?Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, lets go have sex!
Rachel: Were not gonna do this, all right? Shes just gonna thinkthat were doin it.
Rachel: Who is it?
Rachel: Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him tofollow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)
Rachel: Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) Maywe help you?
Rachel: All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Rachel: No you dont know why!
Rachel: Because! Because I was sad.
Rachel: Look, I am soso happy for you guys, but you getting married justreminds me of the fact that Im not. Im not even close. And I dont know,maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that thats dumb, but ohmy God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Rachel: Anyway sweetie, I am, Im so sorry I ruined your night.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Yeah, so lets get started on the wedding plans!
Rachel: Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, thecaterers, the music
Rachel: Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks

Rachel: Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
Rachel: Hey Joey, what cha doing?
Rachel: No.
Rachel: Joey, did you my face cream?
Rachel: Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?
Rachel: (gasps) You found my book?!
Rachel: Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Rachel: Hey-hey, yknow what? I dont care! Im not ashamed of mybook. Theres nothing with a woman enjoying a littleerotica. Its just ahealthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (Shegoes into her room.)
Rachel: Well what happened at dinner?
Rachel: Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys aregonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Rachel: No, yknow what? Its gonna be okay. I mean you donthave to have this rustic Italian feast. Yknow? And-and you dont need, youdont need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear offthe rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)
Rachel: Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Rachel: Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Rachel: Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!
Rachel: (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Rachel: (quietly) Joey.
Rachel: Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Rachel: Well no, I dont smell anything.
Rachel: Nothing!
Rachel: Yknow, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Rachel: Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was withyou. (Exits.)
Rachel: Who are you supposed to be?
Rachel: Do you even know what a vicar is?
Rachel: (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, its enough all right?! You keepmaking these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and itsImnotits just not funny anymore!
Rachel: All right! Yknow what? Thats it! You wanna do it?!Lets do it!
Rachel: (starting to move closer to him) Thats right, I wanna do it withyou! Ive been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Rachel: (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, Ive been waitinso long to get on that body!
Rachel: Yeah thats right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Rachel: Oh, come on now, dont keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But,I would keep that helmet on because youre in for a rough ride! (He backs intothe door.)
Ross and Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Yeah, what?
Rachel: Yeah-yeah, did-didnt you use to have a pair? They were reallyround, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm
Rachel: Yes!
Rachel: Oh, yknow what you should get em? One of those little uh,portable CD players.
Rachel: Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Rachel: Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
Rachel: Yeah! Ive been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dadbought me my own boat.
Rachel: What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Rachel: That is the Coast Guard. 
Rachel: Joey, just ignore the boats all right? Were not finished with thelesson yet.
Rachel: Okay, Im just gonna go over the basic points just one more time,are you ready?
Rachel: Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give alittle shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, lets do that Sailor Joe. Quickquestion though, (grabs some of the rigging) whats this called?
Rachel: Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Rachel: No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Rachel: Times up, now your dead.
Rachel: Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do notknow what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to yousailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)
Rachel: Dont just say yes! This isnt a game, Joey you can really gethurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Rachel: (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Rachel: I dont know. Yknow, they didnt get us anything.
Rachel: Well hello! So, when are we gettin back out on the water matey? 
Rachel: Why not?
Rachel: What? I was just trying to teach you.
Rachel: Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldnt move your armsbecause you were wearing three life jackets.
Rachel: Look Joey, Im sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gottatell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me allthe time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Rachel: Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Rachel: Yeah, I didnt want you to get hit by the boom!
Rachel: All right, yknow what? I-Im sorry. I will try to tone itdown and uh stop yelling.
Rachel: I wont boss you around.
Rachel: And, Ill be nice.
Rachel: AndJoey!
Rachel: Okay Joey honey, youre doing really good! All right, now Imjust gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember whichside is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Rachel: Right?
Rachel: Its left sweetie, but thats okay sweetie, thats atough one.
Rachel: Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side ofthe boat.) The left!
Rachel: (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)
Rachel: No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Rachel: Okay Joey, were luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up thecunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped workingefficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)
Rachel: Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)
Rachel: (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did notsee the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson!I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Whichobviously is an impossible thing to do!
Rachel: What do you mean you quit?! You cant quit!
Rachel: Because youre not finished yet and I wont have it! Greens donot quit!
Rachel: Oh my God, wait did II just said Greens dont quitdidnt I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens dont quit?!
Rachel: No! No! No! Im not yelling at you, Im just yelling near you.Oh God Joey, ohh Im my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! Ive been trying sohard not to be my mother I did not see this comin. Oh, Joey, Im sorry.Im so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: Awww
Rachel: Left.
Rachel: Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Rachel: Ohh were not sailing.
Rachel: All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.)Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees whats in the cooler.) Sandwiches!
Rachel: (hands him one) Here you go.
Rachel: Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that thestuff falls out.)
Rachel: Ohh, sorry.
Rachel: Ohh whoops.
Rachel: Thats nice.
Rachel: Well that was ummOkay.
Rachel: Ohh no you dont! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Rachel: What are you gonna do Pheebs?

Rachel: Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Rachel: How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? Ill pay.
Rachel: Im not asking you to go on a date with him!
Rachel: Joey, just-just he-hes new in town and I know he doesnt haveany guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. Ill reallyappreciate it.

Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: (entering) Hi!
Rachel: So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Rachel: Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Rachel: Yknow, all the women.
Rachel: All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay,just the idea of you and he and all these women, its justAnd I know hesmy assistant and I cant date himbut it just bothers me, all right?!
Rachel: All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow andunsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
Rachel: I just dont want him to meet anybody until I am over mycrushAnd I will get over it. Its-its not like I love him, its justphysical! ButI mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crushon you when I first met ya!

Rachel: Me too!
Rachel: Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Rachel: Hypothetically!
Rachel: Uh-hmm.
Rachel: Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.
Rachel: Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything wecan to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (Awoman at the table behind them overhears Chandlers name and starts listeningcloser), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that
Rachel: Fine!
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: Really?!
Rachel: Oh my God Phoebe! I mean Im justWait a minute. If Imyour maid of honor that means you are Monicas.
Rachel: Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monicas!
Rachel: Why does it matter so much to you?!
Rachel: What-what if I marry RossOr Joey?
Rachel: Yeah but Phoebe
Rachel: Okay. Okay. Itssince youve never done it before youcan be Monicas made of honor.
Rachel: Im gonna marry someone good yknow.
Rachel: Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, "Like whatisnt?")
Rachel: Phoebe is gonna be Monicas maid of honor!
Rachel: (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!

Rachel: How come you are?!
Rachel: Oh, come on! This is crazy! Cant we just flip a coin?!
Rachel: Okay. Okay fine, yknow what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.(Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Rachel: Okay, uh
Rachel: its gonna be okay!
Rachel: Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Yknow,its-its just because of all the anticipation and you just have to rememberthat you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You dont get to keep thegifts.
Rachel: Thanks!
Rachel: Thank you judges.
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Rachel: Ohh, wait a minute, we havent pre
Rachel: Okay! Okay! Umm, Websters Dictionary defines marriageas (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind!Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just acouple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although heseemed like a six year old.
Rachel: Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, Ive known them separately andIve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you aretruly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holdsit up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upontogether. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Rachel: Aw, thanks!
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where Ive heard thatbefore.)
Rachel: No! Yknow what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this wasridiculousWere gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips thecoin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)
Rachel: Well yknow what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her,her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)
Rachel: Hi Pheebs.
Rachel: Hi! I just want to apologize. Im really sorry I was a baby.
Rachel: Yeah. Yeah, and yknow you-you deserve to win. And-and yknowI was thinking about it, if-if youre Monicas maid of honor that means I get tobe yours.
Rachel: Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I startedputting some stuff together, yknow just in case
Rachel: Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God thisis funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (ShowsPhoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was WonderWoman. Oh and heres a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse)Yknow I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Rachel: And umm, vintage handkerchiefs yknow cause, people cry atweddings. (Starting to cry.) Im just gonna grab a couple of these.
Rachel: Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I wassaving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monicas something borrowed and itsblue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah
Rachel: You do? Why?
Rachel: But Pheebs, yknow you earned it.

Rachel: Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Rachel: Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds anaked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confrontsJoey.)
Rachel: What-what?! Youre gonna leave this person with me?!
Rachel: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Rachel: Yknow what? Thats a lot to remember, cant I just tellher youre a pig?
Rachel: Well forget it, Im not telling that girl anything. That is not myresponsibility.
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.

Phoebe and Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Rachel: I know!
Rachel: Oh and Ill call ya too!

Rachel: Oh Joey, Im sorry I just couldnt tell her all those thingsyou wanted me to tell her. And yknow we got to talking and I
Rachel: Cupid.
Rachel: Look Joey, come on shes so perfect for you! I mean shessweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Rachel: Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Rachel: Fine. (They start to walk away.)
Rachel: Phoebe!
Rachel: Im sorry?
Rachel: Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Rachel: Yeah, there was. It wasthere the corner of the library where-whereall these dusty books that nobody ever readYes, there was.

Rachel: Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?
Rachel: Do you want some pancakes?
Rachel: All right, I got 48. 
Rachel: (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting? 
Rachel: Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town,so he's spending Thanksgiving with her. 
Rachel: Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is sodelicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. 
Rachel: Seriously, it's moving! 
Rachel: (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here? 
Rachel: Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to yourgirlfriend? 
Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry. 
Rachel: Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? 
Rachel: Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question? 
Rachel: When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amountof time to wait before you make a move? 
Rachel: Interesting. 
Rachel: Huh. A moo-point? 
Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or didthat all just make sense?
Rachel: You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. 
Rachel: Hey! 
Rachel: How are you holding up? 
Rachel: Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend. 
Rachel: So were you guys together a long time? 
Rachel: Now that she broke up with you? 
Rachel: Yeah. Hmmmm. 
Rachel: NoYeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you knowthat I figure itit has to work out. 
Rachel: Because, uhit has to. 
Rachel: Yeah, I know, I do. I really do. 
Rachel: Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug) 
Rachel: Uh, yeah, well, see, he Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecureabout my back and, andyou're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it,yeah!
Rachel: No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said whathe said, because um, I'm attracted to you. 
Rachel: Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that'scrazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing Iwant to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would bereally great if you said something right about now. 
Rachel: What? 
Rachel: Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else youwanna get off your chest? 
Rachel: (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk andtheyre-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Ohlook, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too) 
Rachel: Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) Ihave a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that Ifreaked him out 
Rachel: (gasps) Hi! 
Rachel: (uncovers the dog) Hi! 
Rachel: Oh, hi! How are you doing? 
Rachel: Oh. 
Rachel: Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. 
Rachel: Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. Ityknow what? Itjust doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really everhappen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and nevertalk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay? 
Rachel: Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out. 
Rachel: Really? 
Rachel: Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday. 
Rachel: (entering, happily) Gooood morning!!
Rachel: Well, why shouldnt I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderfuljob!
Rachel: Come on, its not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up witha plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Rachel: (pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We We are notgoing to let it be a problem.
Rachel: Well yknow, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start togiggle.)
Rachel: Oh Monica come on, yknow I dont sleep with guys on the firstdate!
Rachel: Anymore!!
Rachel: Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Rachel: Okay, thank you. Thatll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tagstarts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closesthe office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going onbetween us. (They kiss.)
Rachel: Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in yourevaluation.
Rachel: Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is requiredto hand in a performance evaluation. But yknow, there is one thing that I have yetto evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.) 
Rachel: No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean thisup?
Rachel: (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?
Rachel: (worried) Okay please, youre kidding right?! I wrote that one as ajoke for you!
Rachel: Im thinkin no.
Rachel: Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I likeyour tiney-tiny touchie.
Rachel: Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote,"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problemswith Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew alittle smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Rachel: Maybe its not as bad as I think. Yknow, maybe theydidnt take it the way I meant it.
Rachel: Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: Oh my God! Joey!
Rachel: Ugh!
Rachel: Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, butwere gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office. Now, he doesnt get inuntil 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat herbreakfast at her desk.
Rachel: Yeah, well Bettys kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure heraway with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her,you get in the office.
Rachel: Lets roll!
Rachel: (worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for youanythingminute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start tousher Tag out.)
Rachel: Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe somechocolates? (Holds up the box.)
Rachel: (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (gettingserious) what would happen exactly.
Rachel: Well
Rachel: Oh no-no-no
Rachel: Youre lookin at it upside downyknow what? (Grabsthe evaluation and throws it out.) It doesnt matter.
Rachel: Whoa! I cant believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Rachel: No, you couldve lost your job.
Rachel: Thank you! Youre great! (They kiss.)
Rachel: What?
Rachel: I It justit took me so long to get that desk organized.
Rachel: (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)
Rachel: (freaking out) Oh my god!!
Rachel: You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Rachel: (to Monica) Did you know he was in there?
Rachel: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Drums?
Rachel: (stopping at Phoebes entrance) Ha!
Rachel: Joey, yknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in theair.
Rachel: What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, Ihad a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then mycat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Rachel: Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Rachel: What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Rachel: And that makes you angry because
Rachel: Where did you get that?
Rachel: Phoebe?
Rachel: Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of theapartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, youknow how fish freaked me out!
Rachel: It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna livetogether, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Rachel: Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
Rachel: We did!
Rachel: Oh, I would love to!
Rachel: Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets thesticks)
Rachel: (with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage andputs the sticks into it) Done!
Rachel: Oh wow! Look at this place!
Rachel: (yelling from another room) Oh my God!
Rachel: (returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that yourgrandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Rachel: And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would findout and then tear it down?
Rachel: Do you really not know where Im going with this? (Phoebe nods,"No.") It left! Its one huge room!
Rachel: See?
Rachel: You cant, because of the new skylight!
Rachel: So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Rachel: Oh yeah? Startin to feel her again there are we?
Rachel: Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Rachel: Phoebe, its okay. I like living with Joey.
Rachel: Oh please, I hate packing, its closer to work, and we do have fun.Although, Im really gonna miss living with you.
Rachel: I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen,Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keepthe one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Rachel: (entering with Phoebe) Hey! 
Rachel: (seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the EasterBunnys funeral in here.
Rachel: Oh.
Rachel: I got it!
Rachel: Its back in cage!
Rachel: Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Rachel: (Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.
Rachel: Oh, yknow I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I(Chandlerputs a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God,this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over tolook at the label on the box.)
Rachel: Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs.Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.
Rachel: Why, why not?
Rachel: Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Rachel: (taking a bite) Oh, Im sorry what?
Rachel: Umm, I think hes still out. Whats wrong?
Rachel: (reading the note) "Pheebs, cant make it, got a date. Talk toyou later. Big Daddy." (Laughs) Big Daddy?
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?
Rachel: Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago andyou want more?
Rachel: It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, grahamcracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling (Pause) Wow! Mywhole mouth just filled with saliva! 
Rachel: Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were nottempted.
Rachel: Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with thecheesecake.)
Rachel: What? Wait a minute, I didnt pay, I thought you paid!
Rachel: (gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Bravermanis still lying in front of her door.)
Rachel: She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
Rachel: No that could kill her.
Rachel: No so were protecting her.
Rachel: But we should move quick.
Rachel: Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Rachel: (taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some? (He makes adisgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)
Rachel: (with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)
Rachel: Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Areyou gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We aredesert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Rachel: What?! What?!
Rachel: Wait a minute!
Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you dont!
Rachel: You think I trust you with it?! No! Were gonna split it! You takehalf and I take half!
Rachel: What? Oh, well then yknow what? I think Monica would be veryinterested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
Rachel: Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.
Rachel: Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Rachel: Thats also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay,there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, anddont come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. (As shes sayingthat she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to herplace, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) Oh!!!!
Rachel: Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Rachel: Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!
Rachel: Hey, come on now!
Rachel: No. No, you cant.
Rachel: Oh I dont-I dont know.
Rachel: Yeah actually, I think were gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Rachel: Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Rachel: Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)
Rachel: You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable.
Rachel: Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you sendthose contracts to Milan?
Rachel: No seriously, yknow the contracts I gave you, did you overnightthem?
Rachel: Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do thatI dont get.
Rachel: Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (Hestarts laughing.) Tag! Im serious! This isnt funny! Those contracts absolutelyhad to go out today!
Rachel: Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Mustgo out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart inthe corner because I didnt want to seem to bossy.
Rachel: Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see thosecontracts sitting on your desk.
Rachel: Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking onthe phone with your crotch!
Rachel: No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office.
Rachel: Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachelsuddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhookthis? (Her bra.) Nice work!
Rachel: Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean,this is what Im talking about! You have to be organized! Youve got newspapers!Youve got magazines! You gotOhh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? Alittle young for you Tag, but whatever.
Rachel: Okay, very cute braces. Anyway yknow what, the point isTag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goesinto her office.)
Rachel: In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He putthem on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it (Looks down onto her desk and findsthe folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gaveTag) that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! Allright?
Rachel: Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room,maybe you left the contracts in there?
Rachel: I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay?Its not a perfect world! Just go please.
Rachel: Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottomdrawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up thephone.) I still dont get it.
Rachel: Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh (She looks for a place to set iton his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) fair enough. So! Doyou got anything for me?
Rachel: Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all thedrawers!
Rachel: Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, noits not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom oneand he opens it. She doesnt see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)
Rachel: (thinks) Yknow, I dont-I dont know. Let me, let mecheck. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at Tag, looks intoher office, and finds the folder on her desk.)
Rachel: Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Rachel: You put these on my desk!
Rachel: Oh really? So youre saying they just slid out of yourbottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (I think Dogbertshould have a line here.)
Rachel: (pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) Iam so hot for you right now.
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Well, yknow I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Rachel: So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Rachel: And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Rachel: No?
Rachel: Im sorry, Rosita? As in
Rachel: Joey, its just a chair! Whats the big deal?
Rachel: Stevie the TV?
Rachel: No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.)Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pullingon the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!
Rachel: Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Rachel: Okay, come onJoey, Ill buy you a new one! All right?Well go down to the store right now and well-well get you a new chair.
Rachel: But dont you think Rosita wouldve wanted you to move on? Imean yknow, she did always putyour comfort first.
Rachel: (grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?
Rachel: You will like it!
Rachel: You dont even know!
Rachel: Well look, if you dont like this(The audienceslaughter at Chandlers progress cuts out the rest of Rachels line.)
Rachel: Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one inthe store! Hey, yknow what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Rachel: Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actuallymove Rosita out of here. Yknow, start the heeling process?
Rachel: Thats weird.
Rachel: Its not a miracle Joey! Im sure theres someexplanation.
Rachel: Joey, I really dont
Rachel: Well no.
Rachel: No, yknow what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Orsomething!
Rachel: Thats right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.(She sits down in the chair.)
Rachel: (grabbing a beer out of the chairs fridge) I am so psyched I keptthis chair for myself!
Rachel: Hey, howshows the uh, miracle chair?
Rachel: Yeah? Wow! Yknow, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Rachel: Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Rachel: Hey Chandler!
Rachel: How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rollingmassage, and speakers in the head rest?
Rachel: Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Rachel: I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. (Which is an actualproduct by the way, Im not sure about the 3000 part.)
Rachel: Well, its a long story, but umm I broke Joeys chair
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Ohhhhh. Thats how it got fixed!
Rachel: Noo! (Laughs) Angels.
Rachel: What? Wh-hey!
Rachel: Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Rachel: No Joe, no miracle.
Rachel: Uh-huh! Nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! All right?That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!
Rachel: No-no-no! This chairs not going anywhere.
Rachel: The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough tobreak a chair in half!
Rachel: Were the Cobras!
Rachel: Ahhhh.
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Rachel: Good ones?
Rachel: Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Rachel: Yknow, Im still 29 in Guam.
Rachel: Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting tothis?
Rachel: Look, yknow I know my lifes going pretty well, but I lookaround and I just see so many people whove accomplished so many other goals by thetime theyre thirty.
Rachel: There you go!
Rachel: Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs.Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Rachel: Nothing. I dont want to do anything.
Rachel: Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I knowits really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Rachel: Yknow what? I am going to do something today. Im not justgonna sit around like some old lady. Im gonna get something pierced. Like my uh,like my nose or my tongue or something.
Rachel: So what?! Yknow what? The way I see it(Phoebe pulls out ahair from the back of her head)Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Rachel: (glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment. 
Rachel: (entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! Shes coming!
Rachel: Whats-whats going on? Phils really pissed!
Rachel: Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Rachel: Ahh!
Rachel: (opening it) A scooter! (Shes not happy.)
Rachel: No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.) 
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! Itsbetter to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down aseveryone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) Thats funny,yeah!
Rachel: (crying) No, I know! I get it! Its funny!
Rachel: No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and havechildren and I dont have any of those things. Thats why its so funny.(Runs into her room crying.)
Rachel: Well, I feel fine, but I think youre bumming out the rest of thekids.
Rachel: Okay! Yknow what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about nothaving a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have threekids
Rachel: As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kidsby the time Im 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry thisplan!
Rachel: So, if I wanna have my kid when Im 35, I dont have to getpregnant until Im 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternityclothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant
Rachel: No, so I dont have to get married until Im 33! Thatsthree years, thats three whole yearsOh, wait a minute though. Ill need ayear and a half to plan the wedding, and Id like to know the guy for a year, yearand a half before we get engaged Which means I need to meet the guy by the timeIm thirty.
Rachel: No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I shouldalready be with the guy I wanna marry!
Rachel: (To Chandler) Im telling you its like watching Bambi learnhow to walk.
Rachel: Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh, poor Pheebs.
Rachel: Ross, I really dont think
Rachel: Hey Joey, can I
Rachel: Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Rachel: Whatever! Okay, Im not your mother.
Rachel: Not in the street!!
Rachel: (to Tag) Hi.
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Yeah, Im doing okay. Im umlets talk.
Rachel: Umm
Rachel: Ohh Tag, ummyoure such a great guy and we have sooo much funtogether but I dont-I dont
Rachel: Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, butI just think Im past the point where I think I can yknow, just have fun.
Rachel: Yeah, it is! But youre just a kid! I mean youre 25!
Rachel: Oh God! Yknow what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Wellactually, if Im wishin for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Rachel: Yeah, Im sorry. (They hug.)
Rachel: Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Rachel: (starting to cry) Ohh
Rachel: Yeah, its just yknow
Rachel: Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Rachel: (crying) Itll be a short one.
Rachel: Ohhh
Rachel: Wait, what do you mean youre getting a new brain?
Rachel: She is so good at throwing drinks in peoples faces, I mean Idont think Ive ever seen her finish a beverage.
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Rachel: (They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay.
Rachel: Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Rachel: Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Rachel: All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)
Rachel: Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Rachel: What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it andI answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story?Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Rachel: What? Wait! Whywhy do you get the story?
Rachel: Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Rachel: Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Rachel: Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didnt think Id loveagain.
Rachel: Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Rachel: Well umm, maybe we could uhh (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!! 
Rachel: No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair! Okaylook, I have an idea. Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he hason his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. Andthen whoever does gets the phone.
Rachel: I dont think so.
Rachel: (checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial ismom.
Rachel: Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the lastblueberry muffin.
Rachel: Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isnttelling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! Thats a steak house!
Rachel: (looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! Hes got Barneyson his speed dial.
Rachel: (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!
Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
Rachel: How are ya?
Rachel: Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that Iwas going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?
Rachel: And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if itrang I could just pick it up?
Rachel: And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Rachel: You stole the phone!
Rachel: No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?
Rachel: Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my newringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebes bag starts to ring.) Oh, itdoes work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebes handbag.)
Rachel: Phoebe!
Rachel: Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guys phone.) Uhh, hello? (On herphone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please.(To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) Its for me!
Rachel: Oh my God! I bet thats him. My digital fairy tale is about tobegin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be(Happily) Hi! Its Rach (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachels hand,catches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!
Rachel: Phoebe! You cant do th
Rachel: You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Rachel: You just said it!
Rachel: Oh Phoebe!
Rachel: Ohh! (Exits.)
Rachel: Hey! Hey!
Phoebe and Rachel: (simultaneously) Who is it?
Rachel: Well why shouldnt I?!
Rachel: Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
Rachel: (laughs) Youre not the man who left the cell phone.
Rachel: Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)
Rachel: Well be right back sir.
Rachel: I dont know!
Rachel: I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!
Rachel: (turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have towait.
Rachel: (fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you havehim, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Rachel: Ohh

Rachel: Oh, youre one of those. But yknow what? I have twosisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Rachel: Well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh,wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt sotheyd put salt on their cereal.
Rachel: Yeah? You like that one?
Rachel: Im funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, Ive got a ton of these!Umm, oh hearDo you want a good one? Heres a good one. Umm, you uh, you take aquarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you sayto person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin withoutit leaving your face. And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencilline right down the center of their face.
Rachel: Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay?

Rachel: Im not vanilla! Ive done lots of crazy things! I mean Igot-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Rachel: All right, yknow what? If you dont want to believe me aboutthis, why dont you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
Rachel: Oh. Oh, thats great!
Rachel: (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh,tellin Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and Iuh, we made out.
Rachel: Remember?! Wecome on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-thecoconut bikini tops
Rachel: we went back the house and we got really silly and wewe madeout.
Rachel: How can you not remember us kissing?!
Rachel: Wh Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! Wecouldnt stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin together?
Rachel: Yeahbut come onListen, Im sorry I dont want tomake you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesnt believeme.

Rachel: Thank you Phoebe.
Rachel: It happened! I am telling you it happened!

Rachel: What the hell was that?!
Rachel: And?
Rachel: Well yknow what they say, the 23rd times thecharm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!
Rachel: Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Rachel: I dont want to say.
Rachel: Diane Keeton.
Rachel: Monica what? 
Rachel: What is the emergency?!
Rachel: Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, eventhough we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Rachel: Well, yknow, sometimes that helps. (She realises what thatcouldve meant.)

Rachel: Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!
Rachel: (To Joey) Yeah I knowIm goodI got it! (Joey slowlybacks away.) (To the boy) Now wait a minute, Ive got one more thing I have to say toyouoh right! Shut up!
Rachel: No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get mycheckbook! (Grabs her checkbook and runs after him.)
Rachel: Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
Rachel: No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh,I am just awful with children!
Rachel: Really? You think thats all it is? 
Rachel: Wow! What did he do?
Rachel: I cant. Im busy. Im apartment hunting.
Rachel: Yeah, I cant live with Joey once the baby comes. I dont wantmy childs first words to be, (in a babys voice) "How youdoin?"
Rachel: Well, I havent discussed it with him yet, but I know hesgonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her aboutmorning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
Rachel: Not so much.
Rachel: Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Rachel: Yeah that would really be great.
Rachel: Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldnt. I mean if she just diedthis morning out of respect.
Rachel: Shall we?
Rachel: And Im Rachel, an admirer of the building.
Rachel: Ahh.
Rachel: So shes really not dead.
Rachel: Hmm. Do you thinkCould you tell me if shes hanging in, in aone bedroom or a two?
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: How was the game?
Rachel: Oh.
Rachel: Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would justlet go.
Rachel: Oh but Joey, I have to go. Theres no room for a baby here.
Rachel: Honey, its not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a babychanges everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl andtrying to score when theres a screaming baby around.
Rachel: Honey, its so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I cantdo that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
Rachel: I know.
Rachel: I do too a little bit.
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: You gave them to me!
Rachel: All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got abig ink stain on the crotch.
Rachel: What bra?
Rachel: You mean the one that youre wearing? (Adjusts Monicas pinkbra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)
Rachel: What is this?
Rachel: Youre so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! Andyou gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)
Rachel: But Joey the baby is going to be crying, its going to be loud.
Rachel: Its gonna be up all night!
Rachel: Its gonna poop!
Rachel: What about all the women you want to bring home?
Rachel: Joey, are you sure?
Rachel: I want me to stay too.
Rachel: Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! Its so cute!
Rachel: Are you seriousReally?! Its in such good condition.
Rachel: Wow! Whoa-whoa whats under the covers?
Rachel: Its moving.
Rachel: Its still(Screams)Its got a tail! Get it out ofhere! Get it out of here!!
Rachel: Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here.
Rachel: (coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?
Rachel: Im having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
Rachel: Oh no, no, Ill be there too.
Rachel: No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I havent told himIm pregnant yet.
Rachel: Cause I know hes gonna flip out and I hate it when hesangry.
Rachel: What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever sawme doing that again hed make me eat the entire pack.
Rachel: Thank you.
Rachel: (panicking) No you dont.
Rachel: Well you couldve untied it with your hands.
Rachel: Well actually umm
Rachel: (To Phoebe) In case you didnt notice, that is a scary man.
Rachel: This was such a huge mistake. I cant tell him Phoebe. Icant, I cant, I cant, I cant
Rachel: No its okay, this is whats gonna happen. Im gonna waita couple years and then the baby will tell him.
Rachel: Hey, that is thebabys problem. (Dr. Green returns.) Oh,everything okay with the waiter?
Rachel: Well Umm, I got TiVo.
Rachel: Phoebe!
Rachel: Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
Rachel: No, its Ross. Its Ross. You like Ross. (He just shakes hishead.) Oh daddy, I hope youre okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this isa good thing. Youre gonnaThis is your first grandchild! Youre gonna be apoppy!
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Who?
Rachel: February 2nd!
Rachel: I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didnt want him to startyelling at me like I was some 74 Latour. 
Rachel: All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tellhim, Im gonna be strong.
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! (Hugs him and Phoebe glares ather.) Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
Rachel: Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
Rachel: Im sorry daddy.
Rachel: Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
Rachel: Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods.
Rachel: (quietly) Oh no
Rachel: Ross Im so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten thisout with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
Rachel: Oh okay, Ill fix that to. Whats her e-mail address?
Rachel: All right, I promise. Ill fix this. I swear.Ill-Ill-Ill-Ill talk to her.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, Im so sorry about myfather yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. Youre gonna have totell me how you did that.
Rachel: Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we aregonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
Rachel: Oh we justwe drove each other crazy!
Rachel: I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let thelittle things go!
Rachel: Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle andthoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)
Rachel: I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I meanwe all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks ather.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)
Rachel: (entering) Forgot my purse! (Sees them kissing.) Oh, you guys made up.(To Mona) Hes a good kisser isnt he? (Ross goes to close the door on her.)Im going! (Quickly leaves and Ross locks the door.)
Rachel: About an hour ago.
Rachel: Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging itup.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.)
Rachel: (looking at her fingers) Oh myGod! Let me see that! (Grabs thebook from him.)
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Oh Pheebs thats so sweet(Grabs a pair of pants)Ooh,those are so cute!
Rachel: No.
Rachel: Wow! I dont remember him. Honey, are you sure youre nottalking about your imaginary boyfriend.
Rachel: Oh thats nice.
Rachel: Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roastchicken?
Rachel: (entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi! 
Rachel: (sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?
Rachel: Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smolderingthing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, hes Lookat the way hes just staring at me. I think hes trying to mouth something tome, but I cant make it out. (Will mouths, "I hate you.")
Rachel: Hi! Will, right?
Rachel: Hi! Im Rachel Green.
Rachel: Really?! Arent you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I amhaving the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around atLance Davis graduation party?
Rachel: Thank you!
Rachel: All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
Rachel: What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh yknow what? Canwe please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table?The smell is just yuck!
Rachel: Im sorry. What?
Rachel: Umm, Im sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
Rachel: Im-ImI had no idea. Im sorry. I
Rachel: Uh Will umm, I just want to say that Im real sorry for whateverI-I did to you in high school
Rachel: You had a club?!
Rachel: Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Whoelse was in this club?
Rachel: (To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
Rachel: So who else was in this club?
Rachel: So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in anI Hate Rachel club.
Rachel: Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
Rachel: Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just saymean things about me?
Rachel: What rumor?
Rachel: Ross!
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: (shocked) Oh my God!
Rachel: What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)
Rachel: Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! Thisis why Adam Carter wouldnt go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stayin this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)
Rachel: Monica, how come you never told me this?!
Rachel: Joey stop staring! Theres nothing there! Its not true!
Rachel: Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)
Rachel: (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrotein my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, youre such a good person." Notgirl! Person!
Rachel: (reading what he wrote again) "Dear Rach, youre a greatperson. Sorry about your tiney-wienie." (Will laughs.)
Rachel: Yes!
Rachel: I dont care how long ago it was! You told people that I was halfand half! Yknow what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you inhigh school.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
Rachel: Ohh, theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
Rachel: WhPhoebe!!
Rachel: All right, yknowFine! You guys have your stupid little club,but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you!You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)
Rachel: Wow
Rachel: Shes right.
Rachel: You can keep those pants by the way.
Rachel: (entering) Hi!
Rachel: Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Rachel: Return them?! Shh! Theyre gonna hear you!
Rachel: (pause) Hes talking to the baby.
Rachel: Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. Ill see you later.
Rachel: Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey)
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Laurenclothes to prison. It is a waste.
Rachel: I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors
Rachel: Really?! Oh my God! Im successful!
Rachel: Yes! Id love to! Have her come by the office.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Hi Monica!
Rachel: Hi boots.
Rachel: Ahh
Rachel: Well-well you can give them to me! I havent felt my feet in years!
Rachel: Oh Joey, Im hardly a
Rachel: Right! Hi Dina! 
Rachel: Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.)
Rachel: Okay. All right Dina, well lets talk about the different areas offashion that you could get involved in. Lets see, theres design, but you mayneed a whole other degree for that. Uh, theres-theres sales, which is greatbecause you get to travel
Rachel: (stunned) And theres marketing
Rachel: Honey, its going to be okay. Hes been incredibly supportiveof me, and if he gets a little upset; thats what the meatball sub is for. (She givesDina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Honey, why dont you sit down? Dina has something that she wants totell you.
Rachel: Joeytheres something that youshould know. Dina?
Rachel: (To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (Shequickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)
Rachel: What?! Dina
Rachel: I know.
Rachel: What college was that Dina?
Rachel: Joey, what are you doing?
Rachel: Oh Joey this is crazy!
Rachel: All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobbyand Dina) Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, its not legal. Okay?They-they dont have a marriage license, they dont have any witnesses, and thegroom only has on one shoe!
Rachel: Youre supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they canmake their own decisions.
Rachel: Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina)Right?
Rachel: Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
Rachel: Joey, just because theyre not getting married doesnt meanthis is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
Rachel: Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that youwanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why dont you tell us alittle bit about your band?
Rachel: (To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.)
Rachel: Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
Rachel: So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Rachel: Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have alittle moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)
Rachel: No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?!
Rachel: Phoebe?
Rachel: Look at that guy by the window, wow!
Rachel: Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean its like every guy IseeI mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I meannormally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with theway Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Really?! So this has happened to you?
Rachel: Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to storesitting on Santas lap.
Rachel: Ah.
Rachel: Well, yknow what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, Ill ask herabout this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guywho took my blood sample really cute? Yknow who Im talking about, baldhaircut, hairy fingers (Stops when she realizes it was her.)
Rachel: Yes, you are.
Rachel: Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where areyou from? What do you do?
Rachel: Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do youski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
Rachel: Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
Rachel: No. Im very comfortable.
Rachel: No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
Rachel: Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
Rachel: Do you feel it too?
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: Well, lets see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in themiddle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.
Rachel: Okay, even this is turning me on!
Rachel: Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey hows it, hows it going with you andMona? Are you guys still together?
Rachel: Uh Ross? You asked me that.
Rachel: I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipplesthrough that sweater.
Rachel: You gave her a key to your apartment?!
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Phoebe no!
Rachel: No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just doit with some random guy!
Rachel: Yes. Hi, Id like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question?Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie &amp; Fitch. (Joeyenters.) Ill call you back.
Rachel: Its just the pizza place.
Rachel: Im sorry honey, Im just having a, having a rough day.
Rachel: Oh you really, you really just dont want to hear about it.
Rachel: Okay, its justand this is really embarrassingbutlately with this whole pregnancy thing Im just finding myselfhow do I put thisumm, erotically charged.
Rachel: Yeah. So yknow, I have all of these feelings and I dont knowwhat to do about them, because I cant date like a normal person, which is finebecause I dont need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.Just sex, yknow? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feelcomfortable with and who knows what hes doing. For just one great night, I mean isthat really sohardto find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?
Rachel: Well, I gotta get up early and its almost seven oclock.
Rachel: Okay, good night!
Rachel: (entering) I didnt ask you to do it!
Rachel: Youre Joey!
Rachel: Right back at ya!
Rachel: And so bad. I dont even know what youre talking aboutbecause I didnt ask you to do anything!
Rachel: No!
Rachel: Thats the end of this conversation!
Rachel: Never happened! Good night!
Rachel: They made you head of the department!
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Uh, Pauls Café. They got great food and its reallyromantic.
Rachel: Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasonsfor drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancingOh! Take herdancing!
Rachel: Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancyrestaurant. Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun!I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is notfun.
Rachel: Huh?
Rachel: What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Rachel: (interrupting) Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill gowith ya.
Rachel: All right?
Rachel: Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens thedoor to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
Rachel: Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.
Rachel: Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like Im going on a realdate! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear thatgoes up to about(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightlybelow her breasts)there.
Rachel: Yeah, actually thats my roommates.
Rachel: Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watchyourself.
Rachel: Hm-mmm.
Rachel: (laughs) Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.
Rachel: Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
Rachel: Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitutethe three-pound lobster?
Rachel: Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good dateOh, I almostforgot. I didnt pay you the rent check.
Rachel: Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So doyou have any moves?
Rachel: I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
Rachel: Oh my God. And that works?!
Rachel: Oh, you poor little famous man.
Rachel: (looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leanedin. I really almost did!
Rachel: Alright. So whered you grow up?
Rachel: Come on, just answer the question!
Rachel: And so were-were you close to your parents?
Rachel: Why not?
Rachel: (sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) Itsgotta be rough.
Rachel: Huh?
Rachel: Thank you! And now if youll excuse me, I have to go to the restroom.
Rachel: And now youre watching me walk away.
Rachel: I am not gonna answer that!
Rachel: No one! They are my friends, I wouldnt punch any of them.
Rachel: Yeah, but I dont know why. Look at me, Im having such awonderful time!
Rachel: I know!
Rachel: Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
Rachel: Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
Rachel: All right, now dont judge me. I normally wait until my dateleaves, but you live here. Im ripping into this swan.
Rachel: So tell me, what are Joey Tribbianis end of the night moves?
Rachel: How do you do that?
Rachel: Oh my God!
Rachel: No, I dont want to tell you.
Rachel: Because its embarrassing.
Rachel: (laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when wereat the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for asecond, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesnt soundlike anything, but I swear it works.
Rachel: All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
Rachel: you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
Rachel: Well, why didnt you just take a cab?
Rachel: Well youre not gonna be able to keep doing this.
Rachel: You what?
Rachel: Right. Wow!
Rachel: Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
Rachel: Relax! Its not like its Citizen Kane!
Rachel: Yeah I know its really boring, but its like a big deal.Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
Rachel: Well dont you have that big date tonight?
Rachel: Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
Rachel: After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
Rachel: I dont know! (Pause) Im-Im kinda thinking it-it wasthe lobster
Rachel: Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
Rachel: Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?
Rachel: Oh God! Thank God youre home! Im watching Cujo.
Rachel: Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
Rachel: No! No! Seriously, whats wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, whatare you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
Rachel: Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Rachel: Yknow, I never thought Id say this about a movie, but Ireally hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachelwhos in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protectme.
Rachel: Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay, thats him! Thats him! ThatsCujo! Thats Cujo!
Rachel: Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now? I cant watch! (DragsJoey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this?Arent you scared?
Rachel: (coming from her room) Hi, sweetie.
Rachel: Hi! Oh, Ross, dont forget, we have that doctors appointmenttomorrow!
Rachel: Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
Rachel: Popular.
Rachel: Oh yeah! Ive come up with a bunch of ideas!
Rachel: Really?!
Rachel: Okay! I was thinking if its a girl, how about Sandrine? ItsFrench.
Rachel: Okay fine, what do you have?
Rachel: Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
Rachel: Im really, really not.
Rachel: All right.
Rachel: Yeah! I dont think youre going to need it though. Okay, checkthis out. If its a girl, Rain.
Rachel: Why?
Rachel: Ross, why do you hate our child?
Rachel: Okay, James.
Rachel: But only if its a girl.
Rachel: Oh! Im sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
Rachel: Veto. Sawyer?
Rachel: Veto.
Rachel: Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
Rachel: But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whetherits a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
Rachel: Right. Right.
Rachel: (looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) So, which of thesebabies do you think is the ugliest?
Rachel: Third one from the left?
Rachel: What?! 
Rachel: I didnt!
Rachel: Okay fine, I did. But I didnt see anything, I swear.
Rachel: Okay, but Ross just listen to me
Rachel: But I couldnt even if I wanted to, because I dont know! Iswear; I didnt see anything, and I dont want to know! It was just a momentarylapse.
Rachel: (holding stomach) Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: You know what? Ive been thinking about it. Im really comingaround on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
Rachel: I didnt see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
Rachel: I wouldSequoia?
Rachel: Fine.
Rachel: But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Ross, I swear, I dont know.
Rachel: A what?!
Rachel: Were having a girl?
Rachel: Thats what you just said!
Rachel: You said girl!
Rachel: Im not! Were having a girl! Sometimes I cant believeits with youBut still! Were having a girl!
Rachel: Oh, yes! Well have ourselves a little baby Ruth
Rachel: Yes, please.
Rachel: (entering) Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing inhere? (Looks at Chandler) Oh, my! (Covers the spot where Joey wants bubbles to bereplaced.)
Rachel: No, I was waiting for you!
Rachel: Were having a girl.
Rachel: (entering) Hi, sweetie.
Rachel: Oh Joey, Im so happy things worked out for us that werehaving this baby together. I love you so much.
Rachel: And I hope its not an inappropriate time to say this but,youre the best sex I ever had.
Rachel: (bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!
Rachel: Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
Rachel: Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feelthis?!
Rachel: Yes!
Rachel: Oh, okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)
Rachel: Aw, its unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, sheslike ummohwhos that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
Rachel: Mia Hamm!
Rachel: (looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Rachel: Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do(Mimics him) that again.
Rachel: Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he wassleeping
Rachel: Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. IdontWhoa!! (Winces in pain.)
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: Okay. Oh GodOw!Oo!
Rachel: Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it youve had one of these Braxtonthingies?
Rachel: Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being sonice and calm.
Rachel: But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
Rachel: But IBut everything is okay. Im fine!
Rachel: Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctors uterusthough. Mild discomfort, whats he talking about?
Rachel: Yeah, everythings fine!
Rachel: Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
Rachel: Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
Rachel: Oh, I gotta go back in there.
Rachel: No, everythings fine. I just gotta go back
Rachel: I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)
Rachel: Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
Rachel: Ohh! Thats so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of thesandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?
Rachel: Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)
Rachel: Yeah, Ill be fine. But could someone please make sure thatsandwich is gone when I get out there?
Rachel: (entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
Rachel: Whats up?
Rachel: (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
Rachel: But Joey, I dont think Ross wants me to move into his apartmentand disrupt his life like that. I mean(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)Orhe does.
Rachel: But Ross, its you and me!
Rachel: I dont know. Is it crazy?
Rachel: Okay, lets do it. Ill move in.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Hi! Hey, Happy Valentines Day!
Rachel: Its good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel allday long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in theMiddle Ages? (to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee) Oh, thank you. Ill seeyou guys later.
Rachel: (entering) Hi.
Rachel: I accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) Whois this?
Rachel: (talking with a higher voice, and puckered lipskind of like you do toa baby or...wella puppyits hard to explain. Just use your imagination!)Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but Ive got to go towork! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do.(still talking like that) Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously cant stop it. (exits)
Rachel: Oh, Ive got big Valentines plans! Ive got my Chinese foodon the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
Rachel: Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
Rachel: Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get hermoney)
Rachel: (entering) Oh, hey, Mona!
Rachel: Ill be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)
Rachel: Im not here! Thats just my Chinese food!
Rachel: You know what Im going to do? Im going to get in my sweats, andeat this in bed! (exits)
Rachel: (entering) Im just going to grab the phone.
Rachel: Oh, Im sorry! Do you need the phone?
Rachel: (as Ross enters with a present) But, but, Mona, I live here.
Rachel: (entering) Hi! Im so sorry to barge in on your Valentines, butI had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
Rachel: Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
Rachel: Well, now, wait. Now Im all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watchit with me.
Rachel: Cmon, seriously, you guys, youre not going to make me watchthis alone!
Rachel: Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman startsscreaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
Rachel: Uh! Its horrible!
Rachel: Oh, my God!
Rachel: What? Did her ass explode?!
Rachel: Oh, screw you guys, you dont have to do it!
Rachel: (thinking) Youre going to have a baby, and you need to beprepared. Now, youre going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!(Rachel puts the tape in the VCR)
Rachel: (thinking) Hmmmaybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
Rachel: Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!
Rachel: Whoa!!
Rachel: Wow that was a big one.
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out therefor everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. Thats whyI stopped looking for Russell Crowe. Hell find me.
Rachel: (To Phoebe) Well, whats he like?!
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Rachel: Of course, of course.
Rachel: Oh sure. Older?
Rachel: Oh, I was just gonna ask!
Rachel: Oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Rachel: Joey? Whats up?
Rachel: Okay whats up?
Rachel: Well honey, Im late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Rachel: Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where tomeet you. Okay? (Walks away.)
Rachel: and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time hetouches my stomach. I mean Im really worried the babys not going to like him.(Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?
Rachel: No. Not-not for me, but why dont you take off your sweater?
Rachel: Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Rachel: Huh. Wow, I wouldnt think Hobbs would like that so much.
Rachel: Um, sevene-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: So you were saying?
Rachel: Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and Isaid, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, andummnow here we are.
Rachel: (stunned) What?
Rachel: (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, youre kidding! Oh,its a joke! (Laughs.) Its funny. Its funny. I dont get it. (Joeydoesnt say any thing and Rachel realizes its not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay.Umm I-Iuh, wow. Are you uh How did umm When?
Rachel: Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
Rachel: Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I
Rachel: Joey.
Rachel: No! Joey please! Please dont! Please dont leave like this!Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)
Rachel: Can I? (Hug him.)
Rachel: Oh Joey honey I dontI dont want to lose
Rachel: Im so sorry.
Rachel: Yeah, that was a real good one.
Rachel: Joey? Are you in there?
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Is Joey here?
Rachel: Well, at least you make each other laugh.
Rachel: Well, I havent seen him since that night that he told me how heyknow I dont know, I think hes avoiding me. Why is that bagel onthe floor?
Rachel: Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind ofsituation?
Rachel: All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell himuhtell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)
Rachel: Okay, Im done. Do mine.
Rachel: Ah.
Rachel: Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Rachel: Well just ask Mona to give it back!
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but itsnot even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
Rachel: How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, tothe point where we cant even be in the same room with each other?!
Rachel: Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
Rachel: Oh yeah. That makes sense.
Rachel: Ooh, I can do that.
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Yeah its umm Yeah its uh It-itsyknowIts nothing.
Rachel: YeahNo wait! Joey no wait it is. Its something.Its-its ummits my boss.
Rachel: Yeah, and umm my baby.
Rachel: My boss wants to buy my baby!
Rachel: I know I told you, its a really big problem.
Rachel: Can you believe that?!
Rachel: Thats what I told him!
Rachel: Well Ill tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and hiswifeThey-they cant have children. So umm, and thatwe were at theChristmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy yourbaby."
Rachel: Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that wouldve been a much simplerproblem.
Rachel: (entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Rachel: Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
Rachel: Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI thinkeverythings gonna be okay.
Rachel: Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday aboutthat thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
Rachel: (worried) What?
Rachel: Whoa-whoa-whoa, lets say more!
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesnt want to buy my baby! I made thatup!
Rachel: So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldnt beawkward!
Rachel: (To Joey) I cant believe that you yelled at my boss!Im-Im gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
Rachel: Oh Joey, I cant believe you brought my boss into this! Imgonna get fired!
Rachel: Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)
Rachel: Morning. You wanted to see me?
Rachel: Okay look Mr. Zelner
Rachel: Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)
Rachel: Oh God.
Rachel: Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: Its all gonna be okay. Theyre just so happy that Imnot suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as Iunderstand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any otherchild I should bear.
Rachel: Chandler, can you give us a minute?
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Joey, Im really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying tomake things
Rachel: It kinda worked. I mean yknow, I dont know about you buy Ihavent thought about our thing since all this.
Rachel: Yeah I know! I miss that.
Rachel: My gynecologist tried to kill me.
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
Rachel: I, uh, think you already are.
Rachel: Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
Rachel: Yeah, otherwise Im not going.
Rachel: This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys haveany pearls of wisdom? 
Rachel: Hmmm.
Rachel: Thank youwere so excited
Ross and Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Yeah, if youre going to do the ears, you might as well take a passat the nosal area.
Rachel: No, I know I dont either, but ya know what, its their party,and its just one night. And we dont even have to lie; we just wont sayanything. If it comes up again, well justsmile. Well nod along.
Ross and Rachel: Hmmmm.
Rachel: Oh
Rachel: (looking at the check) Unbelievable!
Rachel: Open it! Open it! Open it!
Rachel: But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
Rachel: On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang IsntShe Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
Rachel: Yeah, Stevies an old family friend. (Hits Rosss chest)
Rachel: So would I. You wouldnt think that Annie Liebawitz would forget toput film in the camera.
Rachel: What? Im not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I wantit to be amazing.
Rachel: Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
Rachel: And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.
Rachel: Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said eventhough they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
Rachel: Well, I dont know about that, but some said that I looked like afloating angel.
Rachel: Oh yeah. Thats a great story.
Rachel: Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
Rachel: And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!
Rachel: Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible.
Rachel: It was really fun being married to you tonight. 
Rachel: Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Rachel: That proposal, at the planetarium
Rachel: Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and thestars! It wasreally wonderful! Did you just make that up? 
Rachel: Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too. 
Rachel: Goodnight
Rachel: I will think about it. 
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: So, Im in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digestcrossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine toJoey.)
Rachel: So did they call you to tell you your names gonna be in this?
Rachel: Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plusyknow the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! Andif you do the interview you can mention, oh I dont know, gal pal Rachel Green?
Rachel: Okay, dont listen to him. Please?
Rachel: Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal palRachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! Im gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not justin the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously, proud of you.
Rachel: Oh yeah, Id actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
Rachel: That is the Coast Guard. 
Rachel: Its a trifle. Its got all of these layers. Firsttheres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made fromscratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, thenbeef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.] thena little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Rachel: Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor onit!
Rachel: Hey, come on now!
Rachel: (interrupting him) Hi! Im gal pal Rachel Green, and if you wantthe dirt, Im the one you come too. This might be Joeys baby (rubbing herstomach), who knows? Im just kiddingSeriously, (leans into the cassetterecorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green.
Rachel: (scoffs at him) Yeah, thats gonna get you into Soap OperaDigest. Well I(leans into the microphone again)I would just like to saythat Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
Rachel: You too!
Rachel: Oh, Joey! Sorry!
Rachel: Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain! 
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: Ive never lived like this before.
Phoebe and Rachel: Ewwww!!
Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel: (turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!
Rachel: Oh my God, Jill!
Rachel: This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
Rachel: And you know Monica and Ross!
Rachel: And thats Phoebe (points), and thats Joey.
Rachel: Dont!! (Joey backs away frightened.)
Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: Wow! I cant believe they didnt put it in the part where yousaid you didnt watch soap operas.
Rachel: (entering) Hi!
Rachel: So whats the final head count on my baby shower?
Rachel: What?! You mean theyre not coming to a social event wheretheres no men and theres no booze?! Thats shocking! I dont care,as long as my moms here.
Rachel: What?! My moms not gonna be here?!
Rachel: My God!
Rachel: So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
Rachel: Please, make sure she comes. Its really important to me, I meanits my mom!
Rachel: I dont know.
Rachel: Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)
Rachel: Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I dont even have ahousekeeper.
Rachel: Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actuallythink I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (I think thats your motherscrazy.)
Rachel: Well, however great she was I just cant afford that.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Wh-wh-what? What?
Rachel: Yes. Yes I do.
Rachel: Why did you invite my mother?!
Rachel: She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
Rachel: Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with heris taxing.
Rachel: What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?
Rachel: Youre right. Youre right. I mean Im about to have ababy, I can tell my mother that I dont want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Ohmy God! Shes gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
Rachel: Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)
Rachel: Mom thats okay that you didnt get you a gift!
Rachel: Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
Rachel: But mom, I really know what Im doing. I can handle this.
Rachel: He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
Rachel: Wow!
Rachel: Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! (Shes holding an itemwith a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube andbottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That cant be right. Is that a beerbong for a baby?
Rachel: Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow!Whats this?
Rachel: Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
Rachel: Well thats gross, why dont you just take it outside andthrow it in a dumpster?
Rachel: What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indianfood?!
Rachel: I dont know, Id leave it on the changing table? (Everyonegasps.) What?! Whatd I do? Whatd I do?!
Rachel: Oh come(Stutters)Of course I know that. I mean of course younever leave a baby alone! I mean who wouldshe wouldnt be safe as she would bewith me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Yknow what? I think opening the presentsright now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, Im just gonna maybeopen them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts,and this basket is beautiful.
Rachel: Okay mommy, dont ever leave me. (Hugs her.)
Rachel: So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
Rachel: Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot. Ive read all kinds of bookson pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about whatto do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The babys coming and Idont know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
Rachel: Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
Rachel: No. Shes going to live with us for eight weeks.
Rachel: Yes! Shes gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees thatRoss isnt happy.)
Rachel: I do. I really do. I dont know anything.
Rachel: Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
Rachel: Hello?! I still dont know what the hell Im doing!
Rachel: I hope youre going somewhere with this.
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: Thank you. (Hugs him.)
Rachel: (closing a book) Okay! Im ready.
Rachel: Yes, Ive done my studying and I really know my stuff.
Rachel: Uh, put your elbow in it.
Rachel: Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
Rachel: Check if its wet, check if its hungry, burp it!
Rachel: A card! A card! I pick a card!
Rachel: Yeah but yknow what they say Mon, "Theres no such thingas bad press."
Rachel: I didnt write it.
Rachel: Ross!
Rachel: I am freaking out!
Rachel: My due date is in one week! 
Rachel: That is seven days!
Rachel: (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not haveany of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do nothave a diaper service!
Rachel: Im serious.
Rachel: Okay. Thank you. Thats great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west10th? Because theres this really cute shoe store that has like thislittle
Rachel: (stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! Im sorry, one more thing!
Rachel: Umm, our situation. Yknow umm, what we mean to each other. And Imean we-were having this baby together, and we live together. Isnt that,isnt that weird?
Rachel: Im just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)
Rachel: Oh.
Rachel: No-no-no! No, no, no, were not married.
Rachel: Oh yeah! Actually, thats one of the reasons why were not acouple.
Rachel: Oh. Oh yeah, dont get to worked up over it. I mean it-it soundslike hes a doctor, but hes not.
Rachel: Oh my God! Im standing at a cash register, holding a credit card,and Im bored.
Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
Rachel: Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almostgot something that wasnt on the list. A whore.
Rachel: Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just startedflirting with him.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: You dont understand! You didnt see how brazen she was.
Rachel: No! Im not! I-I-I just think its wrong! Its-itsthat ImHere I am about to pop and hes out picking up some shop girl atSluts R Us!
Rachel: Oh yeah! You reallyYou look great.
Rachel: Chandler, Im not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away fromyou. (Gets up and hurries out.)
Rachel: All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are youabout keeping Ben in your life?
Rachel: Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaursshes holding are arguing.) No! Youre a horny bitch! Noooo! Youre thehorny bitch! No! Youre a horny bitch!
Rachel: So you guys go, have a really good time.

Rachel: Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although youmissed a button.
Rachel: Oh okay, I see what youre doing there.
Rachel: Hi! Youre back from your date!
Rachel: Im fine, but thats not important. Whats important ishow was she?
Rachel: Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
Rachel: No! No, shesShe was nice. I mean, shes a littleslutty, but who isnt?
Rachel: Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called youIndiana Jones!
Rachel: No! Its just that, Kate bothered me. 
Rachel: There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
Rachel: I dont want you to date her!
Rachel: Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because Idont want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know its a terrible thing toeven think this, and its completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at myconstant beck and call 24 hours a day! Im very sorry, but that is just the way thatI feel.
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Really? But Im being so unreasonable.
Rachel: (starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)
Rachel: No, not really. Youre pressing the baby into my bladder and now Ihave to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)
Rachel: Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Rachel: (pause) Wow! I dont know, maybe. Im
Rachel: (laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin with you too!
Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no, no!
Rachel: No thats just(Laughs)Thats just causeIm such a good messer!
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)
Rachel: Well obviously I wont be able to come, for those of you whohavent checked their calendars today is my due date. Well yknow, I just wantto take a moment and thank you guys for how great youve been during this time. Ireally couldnt have done it without you. And I have loved these last ninemonths! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna missbeing pregnant.
Rachel: Thats right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on thecouch) Come on people! Please make some room!
Rachel: You. Like you havent done enough.
Rachel: God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Rachel: (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, thats a great story. Can you tell itto me when youre getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (Tothe baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!
Rachel: Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? Cause Illdo it.
Rachel: They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternityleave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well yknow what? Screw em!If they dont want me there, Ill just hang out with you guys.
Rachel: (overhearing that) What-what about me?
Rachel: I dont. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Justbecause Im pregnant you think Im invisible.
Rachel: Oh, I have to pee. If I dont come out in five minutes itsbecause Ive choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)
Rachel: (calling from the bathroom) All right, whos turn is it to help meget up!
Rachel: Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is asqueeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)
Rachel: In a minute!!!
Rachel: (entering) All right, all right. Lets go!
Rachel: No, Im fine.
Rachel: Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I amsomewhat comfortable.
Rachel: Oh uh-uh pal! Dont call me mommy! Its bad enough you callyour own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)
Rachel: Ross.
Rachel: Can I ask you something?

Rachel: (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! Thatsgreat!
Rachel: Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
Rachel: She has the drugs!

Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Eh, just a tad.
Rachel: Well, we are ready to try anything.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Great! We will do all of those.
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Rachel: Well, there is one thing that we havent tried, but someone thinksthat, (mimicking Ross) "That will open up a can of worms."
Rachel: Why? Why today?
Rachel: Ill take that bet.
Rachel: Well, Im miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
Rachel: Oh honey, dont worry. I really do feel like tomorrows theday.
Rachel: Ross IWe tried all the spicy food. Its not working.
Rachel: I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makesme want to have sex with you.
Rachel: Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! Weknow whats gonna work! Its doctor recommended!
Rachel: Oh come on Ross, weve done it before well do it again,itll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
Rachel: Make love? What are you a girl?
Rachel: But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think ofme as a ketchup bottle, yknow you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it justto get something to come out.
Rachel: Oh, I know it. Youre right. Thats not sexy. OhOh!(Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bedover and get it. (Tries too, but cant quite seem to make it.) Oh God!
Rachel: Come on Ross! Im miserable here! Come on! You started this, nowyou finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Oh wow! What now Ross youre not gonna talk? How on earth will youever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean youd thinkthe damn jalepeno wouldve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! Thats notenough (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!
Rachel: (breaking the kiss) Oh God!
Rachel: Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
Rachel: Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: I didnt uh, really have time to read this part of the books, butdo you think we have time to
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: (deadpan) Yes, the hard part is truly over.

Rachel: Give her some money.
Rachel: Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the importantpeople!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
Rachel: (standing up) Okay. Yknow what? Id have to say I reallydont care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we haveno problem toWhoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!
Rachel: Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathingheavily.)

Rachel: Yeah well it looks great!
Rachel: Hi! 
Rachel: How are you?
Rachel: Yeah it is.
Rachel: Thats so sweet.
Rachel: Oh.
Rachel: Oh no, I really dont want any(He takes the picture)Oh!Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross
Rachel: Here comes another contraction.

Rachel: No-no-dont! Dont leave me here with these people.
Rachel: No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
Rachel: Hi!

Rachel: Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: Well ThatsyknowThatsWevebeen alone for the last twenty minutes were doing okay. Besides yknow what?I-IMaybe we wont be alone, cause lately I-Ithings have beenhappening between me and Ross, yknow? Right before I went into labor, we-we had thiskiss. Yknow? So it might be thethe beginning of something.

Rachel: Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
Rachel: Hiccups.
Rachel: Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What  are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that  when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
Rachel: Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
Rachel: What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well?  What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had  that shot.
Rachel: (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In  a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!
Rachel: Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
Rachel: It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how  do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against  your knee?
Rachel: We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting  sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.
Rachel: Ross said he died. 
Rachel: Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see  him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
Rachel: Why? What was it?
Rachel: Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment  for Emma.
Rachel: Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it  was really, really, really good.
Rachel: I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!!  (To Ross) I don't care!
Rachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate  doctor.
Rachel: Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've  got a baby over here.
Rachel: Bye honey. (They hug)
Rachel: Hello
Rachel: Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know  guys do that.
Rachel: Nooooooooo!
Rachel: well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he  was doing?
Rachel: man sharks. I always knew there was something weird  about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.
Rachel: Ah! You know what honey guys are just different,  they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who  wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that  he unfroze from a block of ice.
Rachel: yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
Rachel: (sits down) Hi
Rachel: so basically you've slept with all the woman in  New York and now you're just going around again.
Rachel: what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
Rachel: yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember  who you've slept with, you're made for each other.
Rachel: Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. (to Ross:) Which one of us should go to dinner?
Rachel: Um, Mon, Chandlers not here.
Rachel: Okay, well thats now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
Rachel: Well, lets see. The first one is: I dont want to. And, you know, Im not going.
Rachel: She is?
Rachel: What about (?) Monica.
Rachel: Ish. I just dont think I can bear it.
Rachel: Uch.
Rachel: Oh-A.
Rachel: You need to learn some new slang.
Rachel: What  Oh! (points inside)
Rachel: I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Rachel: No. Uch.
Rachel: Alright, I cant, I cant wait that long. You have to do somethingknock that door down!
Rachel: What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Rachel: Oh my god, I left the water running.
Rachel: Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Rachel: Is the window open? Because if theres a window open, a bird could fly in there.
Rachel: Ubb.
Rachel: Boy, are you gonna be sorry if thats true.
Rachel: Och, god. (seeing Emma) Oh, thank god, youre okay. Im so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.
Rachel: Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, Im never leaving her again.
Ross &amp; Rachel: (entering) Hey, hi, hi!
Rachel: We got locked out of the apartment, we 
Rachel: N-it wasnt easy, but its your birthday and I did what I got to do.
Rachel: Oh honey, this is for the best, thus Im not distracted, worrying about Emma, how shes doing at home and Im being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!
Rachel: She spit up. Judy! She spiJudy! Look alive, Judy! (they sit down) Thank you.
Rachel: Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
Rachel: Yah, Ill have the soup and the salmon.
Rachel: Yguys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
Rachel: (lifts for a toast) Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast  to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.
Rachel: N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Rachel: Ross, she still has not noticed that the babys sock is on the ground.
Rachel: (to Ross) Could you please get her attention?
Rachel: Phoebe, hi, were so sorry. Youre totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Oh thank god, if Phoebes going, can we please take Emma home?
Rachel: Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
Rachel: Who is it? 
Rachel: Hide my rings.
Rachel: Oh. &lt;opens door preparing herself and then happily  says&gt;   Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Rachel: Um... hi.
Rachel: Aw. 
Rachel: I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
Rachel: Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby. 
Rachel: Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your  vagina, &lt;shakes head no&gt; not the same thing.
Rachel: mh hmm.. 
Rachel: Uh.... its Emma.
Rachel: Oh Amy, you remember Ross.
Rachel: Amy! &lt;pause&gt; Yes I do.. I really do. &lt;grabs  Ross' hand for support&gt;
Rachel: Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
Rachel: God she is unbelievable.
Rachel: Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a  restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush. 
Rachel: What? What happened? 
Rachel: Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk  to you in private?
Rachel: Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I  would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
Rachel: Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has  no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I  would like them to bond. 
Rachel: Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just  going to have to make our peace with that! 
Rachel: Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is  Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon. 
Rachel: Oh we just put her down for a nap.
Amy turns to Ross and Rachel: Why does she keep making that  noise? 
Rachel: Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um,  if something were to happen to Ross or to myself &lt;Ross and Rachel knock  on wood&gt; um you wouldn't get the baby. 
Rachel: See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.  We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected  to the baby.
Rachel: Monica is Ross' sister. 
Rachel: Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.
Rachel: Well actually...
Rachel: Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think  you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent. 
Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch.  &lt;pauses&gt; Uchh &lt;louder  this time&gt; In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you. 
Rachel: UCHH! &lt;much louder and longer then Amy's&gt;
Rachel: Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when  I died and didn't give you my baby?
Rachel: What? What carrer? 
Rachel: Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a  decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear. 
Rachel: Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even  come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby. 
Rachel: I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. &lt;gets up and walks  into the kitchen&gt; And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving  Emily to you.
Rachel: uh huh.
Rachel: Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You,  your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings? 
Rachel: Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
Rachel: I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here  today.
Rachel: ah ha ha. ah ha ha. &lt;evil meancing laughter&gt; It's  forty five. 
Rachel: You take that back.
Rachel: Take it back!
Rachel: Heey man, I work out. 
Rachel: I do pilates. 
Rachel: Bring it on! 
Rachel: Did you just push me?
Rachel: Alright. Thats it! &lt;Pushes Amy back&gt; 
Rachel: Ew! Gross. 
Rachel: Mon, I'm so sorry. 
Rachel: Are you okay Mon? 
Rachel: Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm  sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you.. 
Rachel: Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren  discount. 
Rachel: She needs changing.
Rachel: Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
Rachel: Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Rachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Rachel: Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Rachel: Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Rachel: Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Rachel: That's right!
Rachel: Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Rachel: Oh.
Rachel: (Reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) "Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
Rachel: Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Rachel: (interrupting him) Oh Chandler, stop talking!
Rachel: (opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I love it!
Rachel: Well, not this second!
Rachel: Oh wow, it's so beautiful...
Rachel: What do you really want to do?
Rachel: Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
Rachel: Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
Rachel: Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
Rachel: OK, thank you.
Rachel: Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
Rachel: What? You really think she's hot?
Rachel: And Joey?
Rachel: Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Rachel: Thank you! (goes to get coffee)
Rachel: So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their   hands)
Rachel: Hello.
Rachel: Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma   yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.
Rachel: Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous   and arrogant and obnoxious ...
Rachel: No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And   I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
Rachel: Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf,   I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry,   obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait   'till it's finished.
Rachel: I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
Rachel: Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
Rachel: Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at   my ass". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just   think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your   subordinate.
Rachel: That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know   that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had   a deap meaningful relationship.
Rachel: It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last   name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.
Rachel: Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely   right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name   was Morgan! Huh!
Rachel: Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
Rachel: (to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if   you didn't go after her.
Rachel: Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything   to, you know, drive her away.
Rachel: Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone)   Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll   pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)
Rachel: Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
Rachel: If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
Rachel: Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact,   from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to   you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce   you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin   Mitchelle. 
Rachel: Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his   mother. 
Rachel: Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
Rachel: I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Rachel: Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
Rachel: Shh!
Rachel: (to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the   last person I want to see.
Rachel: God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy   hates me.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet   to see if he can knock you over.
Rachel: Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys   see in her?
Rachel: Yeah, sure!
Rachel: Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the   box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)
Rachel: Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
Rachel: Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
Rachel: whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
Rachel: Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Rachel: Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
Rachel: Mmm hmm.
Rachel: No.
Rachel: Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks   at his watch) ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...
Rachel: Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
Rachel: Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens   the card). "From Gavin"
Rachel: (opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
Rachel: See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such   a hard time?
Rachel: Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Rachel: You do?
Rachel: See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion   of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)
Rachel: Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.
Rachel: No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Rachel: Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
Rachel: You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
Rachel: You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
Rachel: I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.
Rachel: Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Rachel: Who is it?
Rachel: Why?
Rachel: Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin
Rachel: I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick
Rachel: Oh no no no
Rachel: So did I
Rachel: It's just a cold
Rachel: What? What's the matter?
Rachel: Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
Rachel: Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really.(She hears the noise of the key in the lock) Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!
Rachel: I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Rachel: Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
Rachel: Right, right, yes!
Rachel: What?
Rachel: No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.Gavin come out from behind that curtain!
Rachel: OK.
Rachel: I thought it was Ross.
Rachel: There isn't. There is totally isn't.
Rachel: All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place.
Rachel: Yes
Rachel: People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin
Rachel: So seriously...rodeo clown?
Rachel: Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I’ve been looking for you everywhere!
Rachel: Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o’ clock. So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk… somebody here?
Rachel: Who?
Rachel: You’ve being seeing someone?
Rachel: Hi, and I am also Emma’s mother.
Rachel: Wow. She does that a lot!
Rachel: What, what, wait a minute! You haven’t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?
Rachel: Ok, Ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
Rachel: How do you know about that?
Rachel: Oh, that’s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
Rachel: Score.
Rachel: Oh God, I can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Oh yeah.
Rachel: What? Who?
Rachel: Whoa, how do you know about that?
Rachel: Why didn’t I get that message?
Rachel: From the guy in the bar, why didn’t I get that message?
Rachel: Ross?
Rachel: Why?
Rachel: Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
Rachel: Yes.
Rachel: Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I can’t do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!
Rachel: Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What’s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, “what, you live together but you’re not a couple? And you have a baby, isn’t that weird?» And I say “No.You know what, it’s not, because it works for us!» But you know this doesn’t work. In fact this is the opposite of working!
Rachel: And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn’t make sense anymore.
Rachel: Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Rachel: Thank you.
Rachel: Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Rachel: Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're      making it so easy on me and Emma.
Rachel: Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's      in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep,      so...
Rachel: Bye!
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Rachel: I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
Rachel: Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. 
Rachel: Why? What's the big deal?
Rachel: What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
Rachel: So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
Rachel: Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age.      Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around      the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And      oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody      murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!
Rachel: Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
Rachel: Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now      wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant.      That's impressive.
Rachel: Really? What's that like?
Rachel: Really? 
Rachel: Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Rachel: This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
Rachel: I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
Rachel: He's not stoned.
Rachel: Yeah, four times.
Rachel: No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
Rachel: Don't touch my coat!
Rachel: Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
Rachel: Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
Rachel: No.
Rachel: What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
Rachel: Well, uh...
Rachel: Really, really not.
Rachel: All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
Rachel: I just had a rough night.
Rachel: Eww!
Rachel: Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Oh.
Rachel: Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
Rachel: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown      up.
Rachel: Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be      appropriate to give me this.
Rachel: Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would      set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you      up on a date that didn't even show.
Rachel: Hi you guys!
Rachel: Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this  place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff  to baby-proof the apartment.
Rachel: No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
Rachel: Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Rachel: Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Rachel: Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
Rachel: There is a hardware store right down the street?
Rachel: This is easy...Can't do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater  sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. (Fiddles more)
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
Rachel: Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guy's spirit level) Oh oh wait!  You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)
Rachel: Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
Rachel: Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
Rachel: I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
Rachel: No you really think that's what it is?
Rachel: Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your  breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose  bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!
Rachel: Argh. fascist
Rachel: Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
Rachel: Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to  be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present  that's shooting out of her!?
Rachel: Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Rachel: Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. (She suddenly lets go) I  mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
Rachel: I'm so sorry Pheebs.
Rachel: Hey! How was basketball?
Rachel: Oh, no! Who did that?
Rachel: She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
Rachel: Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
Rachel: All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
Rachel: (threatening Joey with a scrunchy): Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
Rachel: What are you doing?
Rachel: Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Rachel: Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
Rachel: Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
Rachel: Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail... 
Rachel: Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Rachel: Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Rachel: Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
Rachel: Joey, come on!
Rachel: I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
Rachel: Original.
Rachel: Then what's that big lump under your covers?
Rachel: That's not Monica!
Rachel: (to herself) Oh God.
Rachel: (yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
Rachel: Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
Rachel: Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).
Rachel: Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!
Rachel: Are you gonna...  you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
Rachel: Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Rachel: Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we allpitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win,we'll split it!
Rachel: Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki,goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
Rachel: Well when I talk to her I almost feel like sheunderstands what I'm saying.
Rachel: Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. Youwere there!
Rachel: She dropped off a casserole?
Rachel: (to Monica)What's going on?
Rachel: Well, there's two spots left right?
Rachel: Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smellall over my hands.
Rachel: You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How areyou gonna feel if we actually do win?
Rachel: Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, butsomebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel?You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take ourhelicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can'tguys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"
Rachel: I don't really care about the Knicks.
Rachel: (touched) You would do that? I never get picked!
Rachel: I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be herfirst word.
Rachel: Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Rachel: Ooh, I have another idea!
Rachel: Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Rachel: Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" ticketswin? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose allyour friends?
Rachel: Chandler, would you just tell her what she did waswrong?
Rachel: All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it'sthe last you're gonna hear from us!
Rachel: (surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! Iwant my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!
Rachel: Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split themup! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, soshe pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)
Rachel: Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
Rachel: Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time theypromoted Sandra over me at work.
Rachel: No, she was just much better at job than me!
Rachel: (To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum'shouse and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
Rachel: Hi mum, put her back on!
Rachel: (on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your newlips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let mesay goodnight to my daughter?
Rachel: (she goes towards the others and she's very excited)Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight toEmma and she said her first words!!
Rachel: She said "gleba"!! (she celebrates)
Rachel: (to Ross) Isn't that amazing?
Rachel: Why-why aren't you more excited?
Rachel: Oh, but of course it is!
Rachel: I don't know all the words.
Rachel: Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goesand picks up the dictionary).
Rachel: (searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba,gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearinginner mass of a certain fungi.
Rachel: You know what? There is a little part of me thatreally thought we were gonna win.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
Rachel: Me too.
Rachel: I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
Rachel: Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
Rachel: (excited) Are you serious?
Rachel: Hey, that was an honest mistake!
Rachel: Yeah, that was an awesome day!
Rachel: Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
Rachel: Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!
Rachel: Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
Rachel: Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?
Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)
Rachel: (watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH!
Rachel: SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
Rachel: NO! (pause) Or, cut!You know, that's your call!
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
Rachel: God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Rachel: Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Rachel: Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Rachel: Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
Rachel: (pause) Kiss me.
Rachel: Kiss me.
Rachel: No, I'm saying...
Rachel: just... don't talk... (she kisses him)
Rachel: (waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new!
Rachel: Can I ask you a question?
Rachel: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Rachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
Rachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
Rachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
Rachel: Olivia.
Rachel: So do you think that my dream means anything?
Rachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Rachel: You took the same class twice.
Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
Rachel: Ok, we're still on that.
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
Rachel: (looks puzzled) How...how...?
Rachel: uh-huh
Rachel: (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake...
Rachel: What...how is it going with Drake?
Rachel: What...that scene I saw was so good!
Rachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
Rachel: So?
Rachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
Rachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
Rachel: (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
Rachel: (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
Rachel: (gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.
Rachel: Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?
Rachel: Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
Rachel: No reason.
Rachel: Yeah
Rachel: (with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!
Rachel: (giggling and whispering) Maybe.
Rachel: (whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with "because") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Rachel: Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
Rachel: Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Rachel: I know them from work.
Rachel: No, one of them...
Rachel: I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Rachel: All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we (Joey enters the hall) Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (Joey enters his apartment)
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
Rachel: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)
Rachel: (angry) You are having a party tonight??
Rachel: And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
Rachel: You do that every year??
Rachel: Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
Rachel: And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
Rachel: OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
Rachel: Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
Rachel: Well, then so you just invite me...!
Rachel: Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
Rachel: (yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system!
Rachel: (she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
Rachel: I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
Rachel: ... Ok, who is this?
Rachel: Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
Rachel: Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...
Rachel: What? Yes, I am!
Rachel: When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)
Rachel: Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
Rachel: Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
Rachel: And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
Rachel: Ok professor or detective?
Rachel: Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
Rachel: Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
Rachel: Nice to meet you.
Rachel: Ok
Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
Rachel: I always loved that!!
Rachel: Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)
Rachel: (drunken voice) I think I am.
Rachel: (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
Rachel: Joey, you're so sweet.
Rachel: Who (looks around)?
Rachel: (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?
Rachel: Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)
Rachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey.
Rachel: (to Monica) Hey!
Rachel: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
Rachel: Please, what about you and Chandler?
Rachel: Well hello (points to herself)!
Rachel: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Rachel: (pause) I'm gonna do it.
Rachel: No.
Rachel: I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls   at the party, GOD!
Rachel: (worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know...   and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying   is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
Rachel: All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
Rachel: Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Rachel: (after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
Rachel: Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Rachel: Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things   that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
Rachel: Well, I would like to have the option!!
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing   away a hundred bucks!
Rachel: I don't care about any of that!!
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
Rachel: I promise.
Rachel: But I am going hunting!!
Rachel: (to the receptionist) Hi there!
Rachel: Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and   here is my gift certificate.
Rachel: And... taped back together.
Rachel: Ok
Rachel: (imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.
Rachel: Alright-y then.
Rachel: Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her   head in the hole and Phoebe enters)
Rachel: Oh... what an interesting name.
Rachel: You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's   direction)
Rachel: (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love   your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)
Rachel: No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause)   Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
Rachel: Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
Rachel: Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have   a friend who is a masseuse.
Rachel: Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)
Rachel: I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy   fingers from playing crummy guitar...
Rachel: (now lifts her head) Phoebe!!
Rachel: For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
Rachel: How could you not tell me you worked here?
Rachel: Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting   a free massage!
Rachel: Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
Rachel: Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there   right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles   and I so admire that! I don't have any!
Rachel: Good for you Pheebs!
Rachel: (speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
Rachel: Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
Rachel: Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
Rachel: (hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
Rachel: Yeah...
Rachel: Oh, well...
Rachel: Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
Rachel: Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Rachel: And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
Rachel: Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
Rachel: That's not what we're gonna do!
Rachel: Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
Rachel: Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
Rachel: I'm there!
Rachel: Bye, see ya. (she goes)
Rachel: Pheebs, that's for men!
Rachel: On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Rachel: Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
Rachel: Sure!
Rachel: You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Rachel: She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
Rachel: I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!
Rachel: Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
Rachel: Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
Rachel: It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!
Rachel: (annoyed) Oh, I get it!
Rachel: I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
Rachel: So can we keep this between us?
Rachel: Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
Rachel: Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
Rachel: Ok, great!
Rachel: Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
Rachel: (sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!
Rachel: (comes out again) What!?
Rachel: Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
Rachel: Oh! What are we gonna do?
Rachel: Oh my God!
Rachel: (yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!
Rachel: Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
Rachel: Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Rachel: (to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
Rachel: (pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!
Rachel: Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
Rachel: (after a pause) Yeah.
Rachel: Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
Rachel: Yeah...
Rachel: (Looks ashamed) I try...
Rachel: No, that's David.
Rachel: (disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg.
Rachel: Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Rachel: Hey! Hey what's going on?
Rachel: Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
Rachel: Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could (looks at Joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy.
Rachel: Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
Rachel: (looking out the window) What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
Rachel: It's not the time Charlie.
Rachel: You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Rachel: Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
Rachel: Ugh.
Rachel: Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Rachel: We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Rachel: (picking up another random badge) Kate Miller?
Rachel: And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Rachel: Thank you. (they walk away)
Rachel: I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Rachel: Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
Rachel: (takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) No.
Rachel: No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
Rachel: No.
Rachel: Joey! (she walks away; Joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)
Rachel: Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Rachel: Oh! (pause) Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
Rachel: Do ya?
Rachel: Later! La...
Rachel: Ok. See you, bye.
Ross and Rachel: Ok, good night!
Rachel: (walking in hurriedly) Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
Rachel: Nooo!
Rachel: Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
Rachel: Homo.
Rachel: All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?
Rachel: (to Ross, in a flattering tone) It was really... great!
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Oh! Weather bitch! (turns the TV off)
Rachel: It's open! (Joey walks in) Hi, Joe!
Rachel: (worried) What, is everything ok?
Rachel: Nooooo, why?
Rachel: (laughing) Oh, that's crazy!
Rachel: ... yeah, it's true.
Rachel: (pretending to be offended) What, hey!
Rachel: W-What are you, what are you talking about?
Rachel: Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
Rachel: Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
Rachel: You know? Forget it!
Rachel: No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
Rachel: Yeah, sure!
Rachel: (nearly whispering) Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
Rachel: Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts (pauses) musings, if you will!
Rachel: Only like a month!
Rachel: What the... DIAL IT DOWN! (Joey goes to sit on the bed) Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! (looks at Joey, who's totally distraught) Ok, dial it up a little!
Rachel: Shoot!
Rachel: I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?...
Rachel: (puzzled) Who...?
Rachel: Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
Rachel: Yeah, he did! (smiling) Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
Rachel: But can it... just... happen a little bit?
Rachel: But why, why not?
Rachel: But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
Rachel: (regretful) I'm sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
Rachel: It's not a big deal!
Rachel: It's so not a big deal!
Rachel: Ok!
Rachel: Ok, I...
Rachel: AAAHHHH!
Rachel: What?
Joey and Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: So.
Rachel: I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.
Rachel: I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t  know why I did that!
Joey and Rachel: Okay
Rachel: Ok, so sorry.
Rachel: I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t  know what happened, I must be nervous!
Rachel: Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t  do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a  little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some  getting used to.
Rachel: Ok, let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods,  but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Ow!
Rachel: Well this is romantic!
Rachel: It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
Rachel: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,  but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take  off my bra?
Rachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!
Rachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
Rachel: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,  and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and  I kept slapping it away!
Rachel: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out  too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Rachel: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have  kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere  and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Rachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true,  we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna  power through!
Rachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through  (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).
Rachel: Hey! Got champagne?
Rachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone  is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove  her bra from under her clothes)...
Rachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very  sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright!  Lets do it!
Rachel: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She  pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like  that huh?
Rachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively,  putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She  pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between  his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)
Rachel: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
Rachel: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
Rachel: What is the matter with us?
Rachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed  to be this... difficult?
Rachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When  you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more  than that?
Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Rachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them  doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Rachel: Right, totally.
Rachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one  of those couples that never have sex.
Rachel: I know.Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what  I wanted. 
Rachel: Hmmm... Me too...
Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Rachel: Aah... I bet you're right.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
Rachel: Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
Rachel: We're having a party.
Rachel: No,   that day... that won't be her real birthday!
Rachel: Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Rachel: And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can   we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
Rachel: You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would   hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure   map to help me find 'em all.
Rachel: Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma   and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
Rachel: Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
Rachel: I said it's still nap time.
Rachel: Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents   on?
Rachel: Oh, she's still napping
Rachel: Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't   a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a   first birthday again.
Rachel: No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
Rachel: Oh! Emma might like what?
Rachel: What did you get her?
Rachel: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are   getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind   performing them once now?
Rachel: (to everybody) All right, let’s get this party started, huh?   Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
Rachel: So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
Rachel: Oh, ok, which one?
Rachel: (crying) Wow! That was amazing!
Rachel: Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
Rachel: Is that it?
Rachel: Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s   in a box in the fridge.
Rachel: Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey,   Corino’s.
Rachel: Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different   shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!
Rachel: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Rachel: Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God!   They put my baby’s face on a penis!
Rachel: Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to   be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
Rachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even   want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a   piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!
Rachel: (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want   my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with   nuts!
Rachel: (into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just   gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna   be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...
Rachel: OOH! God! Sorry!
Rachel: Emma's awake.
Rachel: I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're   not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Rachel: Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday...   And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According   to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
Rachel: (shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this   day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her   cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET   OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks   at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!
Rachel: What?
Rachel: (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a   bunny. How did you do that?
Rachel: Well, I'm very impressed.
Rachel: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks   you guys!
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Rachel: (angrily) NO, no science camp!
Rachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
Rachel: Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Okay. (they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well,   your first birthday is over, and it was really...
Rachel: You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her   first cookie.
Rachel: I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
Rachel: Of course, I'd be honored!
Rachel: OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss,   first time you had sex...
Rachel: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?
Rachel: So now, what are you doing here?
Rachel: (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just   check on the baby!
 Rachel: God!
Rachel: Oh, I know, isn't she?
Rachel: All right. What's your news, Amy?
Rachel: What? Oh my God! To who?
Rachel: A-And??
Rachel: No, what's he like?
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
Rachel: Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the   apartment more than you like...
Rachel: Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married   somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?
Rachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but  anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever  made. Honey, you deserve  true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age,  that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
Rachel: Ok.
Rachel: Ok, let’s keep talking.
Rachel: Amy, hi!
Rachel: Oh, good for you! 
Rachel: Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get   off!’
Rachel: Joey, I can’t do that!
Rachel: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think   it’s really good that she’s here.
Rachel: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was   a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of   me.
Rachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t   think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys.   See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna   take patience, but that’s ok.
Rachel: Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why   I hung it on the door.
Rachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time   for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
Rachel: Well, what happened?
Rachel: Oh, that is so tacky.
Rachel: Phoebe, that’s huge!
Rachel: I think it could be kind of great!
Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands   together, faking excitement)
Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years   ago!!
Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes   back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!   (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
Rachel: Menstrual cramps.
Rachel: (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?
Rachel: (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually... 
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Why not?
Ross: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one?
Rachel: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge   breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
Rachel: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points   at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand   how important that is in our world?
Rachel: Absolutely.
Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah!
Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?
Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me? 
Rachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)
Rachel: Nah, I don't really want her to see. 
Rachel: Nothing.
Rachel: Oh, they're real!
Rachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy)  You are soo irresponsible  I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
Rachel: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure   out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when?
Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?
Rachel: (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.
Rachel: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
Rachel: You put holes in my baby's ears!
Rachel: (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help  you. You are so  beyond help.
Rachel: Excuse me?
Rachel: (yelling) Joey, where are those bags?
Rachel: (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?
Rachel: Hips or thighs?
Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.
Rachel: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're...   you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
Rachel: Did you just say Emma?
Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
Rachel: That's shocking!
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: My God!
Joey: Hey!Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!
Rachel: Mmh-mmh!
Rachel: Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what,   I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends? 
Rachel: (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start   reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna   be interested in.
Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked   it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and   they're the bad guys.
Rachel: Who's Gladys?
Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?  In her house? I am so jealous!
Rachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already   gave that to Monica, so...
Rachel: No, I couldn't let you do that.
Rachel: But I don't want you to.
Rachel: But I insist harder!
Rachel: (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair   and square. I'm so sad!
Rachel: Did you watch the tape?
Rachel: But you are a liar.
Rachel: Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)
Rachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh,   she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh   so proudly? (looks around for a spot)
Rachel: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to   the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be   the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
Rachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's   nothing above your bed!!
Rachel: O-oh my God!
Rachel: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
Rachel: Joey, we're not keeping this!
Rachel: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't   mind that she's haunted. 
Rachel: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive   when you're asleep.
Rachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body   across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice)   And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your   doorknob.
Rachel: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at   this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)
Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again)
Rachel: She's yours!
Rachel: She's yours!
Rachel: She's mine!
Rachel: She's mine!
Rachel: I want Gladys!
Rachel: She's mine!
Rachel: She's mine!
Rachel: Excellent!
Rachel: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not   get old.
Rachel: Oh, don't be such a baby!
Rachel: Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Rachel: Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Rachel: Absolutely.
Rachel: So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
Rachel: Oh my God, what!?
Rachel: Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
Rachel: (upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing   incident... when I was little.
Rachel: Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden   my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut   a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!
Rachel: Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And   I was thinking Claire Danes.
Rachel: Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and   there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're   gonna return back to earth!
Rachel: All right!
Rachel: Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next   time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
Rachel: Ok, careful.
Rachel: Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
Rachel: I know (she touches Emma’s head) but they’re just so beautiful!   Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
Rachel: Ok.
Rachel: Ok.
Rachel: Ok, careful, ok. (Emma giggles) Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God,   she does like it!
Rachel: Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil!   Oh, let me push, can I push?
Rachel: Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.
Rachel: Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
Rachel: Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it.   That is   the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
Rachel: Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else   gets   hurt?
Rachel: (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've   always been   jealous of my hair.
Rachel: Alright fine. I'll do it.
Rachel: If you hold a spider. 
Rachel: IF you hold a spider.
Rachel: Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
Rachel: Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)
Rachel: (reluctantly) Ok... O-k...
Rachel: (more confident) Ok...
Rachel: whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
Rachel: A-alright! I can do this.
Rachel: That's because he's on your neck.
Rachel: ROSS!
Rachel: (to Joey) Hey, who's Phoebe with?
Rachel: Do you think I'm someone else?
Rachel: Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!
Rachel: Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
Rachel: Hi
Rachel: what?
Rachel: Oh! Oh, no!
Rachel: Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
Rachel: Oh no! Not me! Emma!
Rachel: Ah, this place is great!
Rachel: Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful!
Rachel: Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
Rachel: No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
Rachel: Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
Rachel: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.
Rachel: (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?
Rachel: We got some really great stuff!
Rachel: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me? 
Rachel: (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by    mistake, and one of mine is missing.
Rachel: He offered me one.
Rachel: The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)
Rachel: Oh, God! Please, somebody  say something.
Rachel: I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away   from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already   talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever   we need to make us feel comfortable.
Rachel: I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out...   Anything we want.
Rachel: Thank you! Thank you!
Rachel: I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe   and Joey enter.)
Rachel: I got a really incredible job offer.
Rachel: It's in Paris.
Rachel: Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means   a lot if you could try to get on board.
Rachel: (walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so...
Rachel: Joey...
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Rachel: Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph   Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
Rachel: Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out   of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling   apart without me.
Rachel: No, I’m still going.
Rachel: When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,   the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
Rachel: Ralph Lauren called again and they offered   me more money.
Rachel: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll   do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I   don't even know what department that guy's in.
Rachel: Well, I took it.
Rachel: (hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great.   It's certainly the easier choice...
Rachel: Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to   Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital   of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's   fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of   that I possibly can... (she sits down, and Ross who is stunned to hear all this   follows her example)
Rachel: Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when   I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared...   But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)
