Ross: (mortified) Hi.
Ross: I just feel like someone reached down mythroat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around myneck...
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, justleave my aura alone, okay?
Ross: I'll be fine,alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
Ross: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
Ross: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating onthat? She didn't know, how should I know?
Ross: I told mom and dad last night,they seemed to take it pretty well.
Ross: Sorry.
Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... Ijust- I just wanna be married again!
Ross: Hi. 
Ross: (in a deep voice) I'll havewhatever Christine is having.
Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.
Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Ross: He finally asked you out?
Ross: (choked voice) That'd be good...
Ross: (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the WineGuy!
Ross: A wandering?
Ross: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you upto tonight?
Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -biglizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler arecoming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Ross: Okay, sure.
Ross: (squatting and reading the instructions) I'msupposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little wormguys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Ross: (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This wasCarol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Ross: You guys.
Ross: I'm divorced!  I'm only26 and I'm divorced!
Ross: That only took me an hour.
Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What ifthere's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that'sit? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Ross: (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how longit's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anythingto you? 
Ross: Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could getit together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of thewindow.)
Ross: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get youinto bed'. 
Ross: You got a job? 
Ross: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'... 
Ross: Come on, you madecoffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant fromthat morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)
Ross: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... 
Ross: No. No, I gotta go home sometime. 
Ross: Yeah. 
Ross: Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no- 
Ross: No no no, go- 
Ross: Split it? 
Ross: Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back inhigh school, I had a, um, major crush on you. 
Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geekyolder brother. 
Ross: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerabilitybecome any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?Sometime? Maybe? 
Ross: Okay... okay, maybe I will... 
Ross: Goodnight. 
Ross: I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what thatmeans.) 
Ross: There's an image.
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that...that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a littleangry? 
Ross: Does she. 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, thatglacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you inthe Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still,uh... 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right aboutnow. (He enters.) 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm notcomfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with themtomorrow. 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realiseyou guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnantwith my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, theytake their time, they get the job done. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barrytomorrow? 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Ross: Mm. 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he'sgonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look tooterrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll giveBarry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Ross: Got me. 
Ross: Yeah. 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move hishand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this bigdinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So,uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know,when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with thebaby's name? 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how aboutJulia? 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together.Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I everimagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this istoo hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can beinvolved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Ross: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? 
Ross: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, sendour dog off to live on a farm. 
Ross: What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they hadthis unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was-it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! 
Ross: Can I use.. either thumb? 
Ross: Easy. 
Ross: What is this?! 
Ross: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the lasttime you quit. 
Ross: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. 
Ross: Hey, Pheebs. 
Ross: ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, Ican't do this, can't do this. We loved him. 
Ross: ...What shoe? 
Ross: ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all futureboyfriends will be measured. 
Ross: You know what I like most about him, though? 
Ross: The way he makes me feel about myself. 
Ross: Well.. 
Ross: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon whereBugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,second base-Alan, third base-... 
Ross: What? 
Ross: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 
Ross: A thumb?! 
Ross: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. 
Ross: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. 
Ross: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
Ross: If only he were a woman. 
Ross: Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.) 
Ross: (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go. 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? 
Ross: Hey, I might! 
Ross: Is there somebody else? 
Ross: Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way theywere. 
Ross: Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. 
Ross: Yeah. He could row like a viking. 
Ross: So how'd it go? 
Ross: You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes herforehead.) 
Ross: Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, whatabout you? 
Ross: Joey, uh- OMnipotent. 
Ross: I cannot sleep in a public place. 
Ross: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. 
Ross: Why? 
Ross: Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. 
Ross: So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket andcouldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? 
Ross: Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, Octobertwentieth? 
Ross: Ohhh. 
Ross: Today's the day Carol and I first..consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'dbetter pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and herlesbian lover. 
Ross: What are you doing? 
Ross: Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind offit. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? 
Ross: You can totally, totally live on this. 
Ross: Oh, by the way, great servicetonight. 
Ross: Carol was wearing boots just like those thenight that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (offChandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. 
Ross: Peach pit. 
Ross: (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
Ross: Actually, nectarines, but basically... 
Ross: Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... Iwalked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Ross: (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
Ross: No, actually I was just saying it looks likewe're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there thatnight... It was the first frost... 
Ross: Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Notlaughing now, are ya pal! 
Ross: Pass it! Pass it! 
Ross: (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna makeany trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. 
Ross: Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guysback off) Heyy... 
Ross: I remember the moonlight coming through thewindow- and her face had the most incredible glow. 
Ross: Look, it's just a little more complicated... 
Ross: Little louder, okay, I think there's a man onthe twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... 
Ross: My first time with Carol was... (He mumblesthe last part) 
Ross: It was my first time. 
Ross: Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandagedto his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) 
Ross: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? 
Ross: The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,that's, that's my puck. 
Ross: (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you'reglue, whatever(to Chandler)can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back mypuck. 
Ross: 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! 
Ross: (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MYPUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) 
Ross: ...Now that was fun. 
Ross: (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right footred. 
Ross: Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has tobend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively) 
Ross: Green. To the green. 
Ross: Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there'sone little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'mconcerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Ross: Multiple orgasms!
Ross: Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Ross: Tony?
Ross: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakeypie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Ross: That guy, he burns me up.
Ross: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Ross: Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundrythere too?
Ross: Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join youboth, here?
Ross: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... ratproblem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, butthey're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Ross: (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonnabe me and Rachel.
Ross: It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Ross: Nuh-uh.
Ross: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Ross: (sheepish) No.
Ross: Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm asensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick somethingelse up on the way.
Ross: What's goin' on?
Ross: Was your basket on top?
Ross: So?
Ross: No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend'smachine.
Ross: Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. 
Ross: (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to seehere. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry.
Ross: Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, doyou...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
Ross: Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Ross: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Ross: Rach, have you never done this before?
Ross: Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically youwanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a thirdfor your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Ross: (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
Ross: That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I hadto make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'msorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.
Ross: (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it'sa song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Ross: Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Ross: All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all yourwhites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Ross: Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, pleasedon't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Ross: You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Ross: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Ross: Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head onan open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.
Ross: No.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Ross: Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Ross: Is it? Feels like two.
Ross: What?
Ross: Oh. Hel-lo!
Ross: He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Ross: C'mon! C'mon!
Ross: No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Ross: Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean,anthropologically speaking-
Ross: Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Ross: Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Ross: Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Ross: Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll thatwasn't raggedy!
Ross: Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, butyou don't pay it right away.
Ross: Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Ross: Monica? You're Mom.
Ross: C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Ross: You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the bigopening?
Ross: Look at it this way: you dumped her.Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent,unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Ross: No? What happened, big guy?
Ross: It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Ross: Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it'syour shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Ross: She is a kook.
Ross: And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Ross: That's my sister.
Ross: Pheebs, what about you?
Ross: Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
Ross: The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of thosemechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to returnto the Magic Kingdom.
Ross: Step back.
Ross: Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Ross: Come on.
Ross: (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?
Ross: Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Ross: It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you'releft with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So,you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all thatother good stuff.
Ross: But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Ross: Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Ross: Mmmm.
Ross: I do.
Ross: (innocently) What?
Ross: (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
Ross: No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Ross: I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean,every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Ross: I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him)What? What, now?
Ross: Shhhh!
Ross: We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.(everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?
Ross: See?
Ross: (to Joey) OK, here goes.
Ross: I'm going to do it.
Ross: You come out there, you're a dead man.
Ross: Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.
Ross: OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..more of a general wondering... ment.
Ross: OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Ross: Yes, yes, that's right...
Ross: What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
Ross: Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Ross: (nonchalantly) Yeah?
Ross: (rolling) Lucky sixes....
Ross: (jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Ross: No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Ross: That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Ross: (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Ross: Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Ross: That's... that's classic.
Ross: Paolo. Hi.
Ross: Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I...we're kind of a thing.
Ross: Thing, yes. Thing.
Ross: No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see,that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together.You know, and if you get in the.... um... 
Ross: No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way,of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Ross: Yeah! Se vice?
Ross: So you do know a little English.
Ross: Do you know the word crapweasel?
Ross: That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Ross: OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Ross: Oh.. oh... oh.
Ross: Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidordid.
Ross: No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so Itold her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Ross: (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go toRome.
Ross: So, uh, how's she doing?
Ross: Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, andwe still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Ross: Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n'Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Ross: She looks so small. 
Ross: Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. 
Ross: Bye, Nana. 
Ross: Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not,quite..
Ross: She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Ross: I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)
Ross: Now she's passed.
Ross: Twice.
Ross: I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,uh...
Ross: Nono, she's gone.
Ross: I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Ross: (sarcastic) I don't see why not.
Ross: Here's my retainer!
Ross: (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?
Ross: I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spendeternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Ross: Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)
Ross: Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)
Ross: And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Ross: (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Ross: No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Ross: Oh my God..
Ross: Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
Ross: (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?
Ross: Some days it's all I can think about. 
Ross: What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Ross: Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Ross: I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's,there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going hefalls into an open grave)
Ross: I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Ross: What, what is it?
Ross: Oh! No-n-
Ross: I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Ross: Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guysare the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)
Ross: ...Chandler! 
Ross: (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter tome.
Ross: Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.
Ross: No.
Ross: Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)
Ross: That little naked guy would be me.
Ross: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Ross: Got me.
Ross: Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
Ross: (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Ross: No, they're not.
Ross: You're wrong.
Ross: You're wrong.
Ross: (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom.
Ross: (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It'sThanksgiving. 
Ross: Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Ross: Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Ross: (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want tobring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Ross: Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Ross: Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan:Come in.
Ross: Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back tothe museum.
Ross: Kinda like a big face without skin.
Ross: Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books aboutbein' a lesbian.
Ross: (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Ross: The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're...crazy?
Ross: You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Ross: Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Ross: Really?
Ross: Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some bellytime too. Not that I believe any of this.
Ross: Oh, I hate this story.
Ross: I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Ross: That's closer.
Ross: Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. 
Ross: Ok, Mom never hit.
Ross: Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am Italking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certainacoustical advantage, but...
Ross: Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, thisis too weird. I feel stupid.
Ross: (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Ross: And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major.So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let'sface it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Ross: Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Ross: Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniestlooks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Ross: Does it always, uh--?
Ross: (singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. Whenyou come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Ross: (singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Ross: Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
Ross: I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Ross: Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. 
Ross: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Ross: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Ross: Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Ross: Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate iskinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'reallycool way to live'.
Ross: How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Ross: Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)
Ross: Just a smidge.
Ross: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! 
Ross: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Ross: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight thismorning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean,and he- he threw some faeces...
Ross: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you'rethere to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Ross: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Ross: Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Ross: Four.
Ross: Five. (Buries his head in his hands)
Ross: Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the balldrops?
Ross: Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
Ross: Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walkingaround all the time dragging his hands... 
Ross: Really.
Ross: What, uh... what juggling thing?
Ross: No.
Ross: Par-tay! 
Ross: 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask yousomething, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in yourhome?
Ross: Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him tohave the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Ross: Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do alittle mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Ross: (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm notsaying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Ross: Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Ross: (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. Imean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoningit in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love youback.
Ross: C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Ross: Oh, please...
Ross: When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Ross: Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just adream I had- but, phew.
Ross: (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Ross: Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Ross: ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)
Ross: Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Ross: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him andhe tries to pretend he was in the other one)
Ross: Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Ross: No. It's the one he's licking.
Ross: You're good.
Ross: The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
Ross: When?
Ross: The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Ross: Please.
Ross: Right.
Ross: Uh-oh...
Ross: Hey, is Chandler here?
Ross: Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakeshis head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just akiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Ross: Okay. 
Ross: What code?
Ross: Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morningracquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Ross: No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed tobring me one.
Ross: Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Ross: I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know?She's, she's sexy, she's...
Ross: Well... not in the same way...
Ross: Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Well, not playing raquetball!
Ross: He didn't get the goggles!
Ross: Do they wait for me to do this?
Ross: Why would I tell him?
Ross: Oh...
Ross: You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Ross: Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and youknow how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) Ican't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
Ross: I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too muchtequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothinghappened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Ross: Thanks, man, big help.
Ross: I wasn't- I mean, I-
Ross: I know-
Ross: Chandler-
Ross: Chandler-
Ross: Joey-
Ross: I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Ross: Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Ross: Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, Ijust wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Ross: Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Ross: (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Ross: No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tellher how you feel?
Ross: Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs hisfinger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee)That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!
Ross: Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Ross: You're kidding.
Ross: Wow!
Ross: 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonnagrow up and realise I am your mom?"
Ross: So, what's going on now?
Ross: Whaddya see?
Ross: (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.
Ross: You mean that?
Ross: Yeah? How'd it go?
Ross: Well, howdya feel?
Ross: Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing yourmom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to godown that road.
Ross: Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya,you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Ross: Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, nocompass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)
Ross: (waves) Hello!
Joey, Chandler, and Ross: (sitting in living room, imitating Paolo)Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Ross: Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makesflinging motions with hands) flung by now?
Ross: ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Callimmigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!
Ross: Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sendsher love, along with this lasagna. 
Ross: (pauses) I'm pretty sure that it is...
Ross: (making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, tell me, iseverything, uhh....? 
Ross: Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up apicture frame)
Ross: Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Ross: (surprised, chuckling nervously) Of course it's your friendTanya. (looks up frightenedly)
Ross: (chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm having enoughtrouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya (miming washinghair, that's the best I could think of), yaw...
Ross: Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Ross: No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, youknow, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!(pauses) Or isn't...
Ross: Susan...
Ross: Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Ross: (flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guywho doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Ross: Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? 
Ross: (interrupts) No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want toknow. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go. 
Ross: No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach,then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)
Ross: (on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. (Carol andSusan laugh)
Ross: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Ross: Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Ross: Hi Pheebs!
Ross: I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Ross: My God.
Ross: The actress!
Ross: Thanks Rach.
Ross: You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, asa friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys tochime in)
Ross:(sympathetic yet...) Yeah, well...
Ross: I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Ross: (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked yourbutts.
Ross: Come on, two on one.
Ross: What, now?
Ross: (entering) How's it going?
Ross: Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when Isay... (shuts door in his face and walks away)
Ross: Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she'snot overwhelmed...
Ross: (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: You all right?
Ross: Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better thanhim...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when hehas you.
Ross: What?
Ross: Huh.
Ross: Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)
Ross: See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is theanswer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticatedscreening process.
Ross: Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Ross: (astonished) What? 
Ross: I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Ross: Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?
Ross: I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Ross: I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Ross: I'm having a son. Um...
Ross: You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Ross: Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolvethis. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon,he's not that bad.
Ross: Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought onany level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Ross: Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Ross: That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Ross: Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Ross: Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Ross: I dunno, there's just something about...
Ross: We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Ross: So Joey, you okay?
Ross: She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Ross: She lent me an egg once.
Ross: Aw, right.
Ross: Hey. (stutters something incoherent)
Ross: An egg?
Ross: I think it's insane.
Ross: Hi. She said yes.
Ross: I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the wholeum, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to LosAngeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Ross: The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close,personal friend.
Ross: If you wanna put a label on it.
Ross: Nope, nope, that's it. 
Ross: Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Caroland Susan) Helloo!
Ross: So, um, what do you do for a living?
Ross: Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invitedCarol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. 
Ross: Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Ross: Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let'stry scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin.Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that,funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Ross: You did so. I swear, I swear(noticing Kristin's absence) How longhas she been in the bathroom?
Ross: Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I hadin 9 years. 
Ross: Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is stillpretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it offand eats it.)
Ross: No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life"thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, andshe's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin'to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know,here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I knowwhat you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside fornow you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know.You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see,you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Ross: No but, no but.
Ross: That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
Ross: Grazie.
Ross: What's going on?
Ross: Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Ross: Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Ross: OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Ross: Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at themuseum.
Ross: Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring herback to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Ross: Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures)huh-huh.
Ross: Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you!Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
Ross: Alright... (lifts Marcel away)
Ross: OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Ross: (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?
Ross: Ah....
Ross: (panicked) Er.... um..... 
Ross: Um... uh.... vulva.
Ross: Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but itwasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Ross: Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kindof guy, you know?
Ross: (deadpan) Please be kidding.
Ross: OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment...
Ross: That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having thisconversation. (gets up, walks across room)
Ross: Joey, please.
Ross: (impressed) Wow.
Ross: I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Sure.
Ross: OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring atme when I'm doing this.
Ross: Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with mylips.
Ross: I, er...
Ross: I want to take my tongue... and... 
Ross: ....and....
Ross: ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Ross: (rushing to explain) Funny story!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Ross: Oh, I was unbelievable.
Ross: I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filthyou have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif...at one point there were villagers.
Ross: Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk,it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Ross: Yeah, which was nice.
Ross: I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but mymonkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine,"supposedly" by accident.
Ross: And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, andpeed all over the crossword.
Ross: Oh, Pheebs, Im sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Ross: No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve gotlesbians, the whole parenting team.
Ross: No, no. (Distractedly putting on a jacket to go out) I mean, it mighta beenat first, but by now I, I think Im pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Ross: I know.
Ross: Hi, um, Im err, (has to clear his throat) Im Ross Geller, and errah... (pats Carols bulge) ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh,(points) this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols,just, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes incoherentuntil) ..whos next?
Ross: Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
Ross: Like buddies.
Ross: You know how close women can get.
Ross: Although I was married to her.
Ross: Err, right.
Ross: A little.
Ross: Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... hah!Thats like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch.
Ross: It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Ross: Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie theremote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Ross: Relax, Ill fix it.
Ross: (looking at the remote) How did he do this?
Ross: You okay?
Ross: You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Ross: Sorry.
Ross: Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?
Ross: No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both knowwhats going on.
Ross: Okay, Im gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Ross: I see. So what do you propose to do?
Ross: Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
Ross: Susan, go deep.
Ross: Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
Ross: Im gonna be a father.
Ross: I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby washaving me.
Ross: Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating thebath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Ross: No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
Ross: Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.
Ross: Rach, did you proofread these?
Ross: Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuperskills.
Chandler and Ross: Hey.
Ross: I don't know.
Ross: No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who doessomething for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (beginsto stare lovingly at Rachel)
Ross: What?
Ross: Who?
Ross: Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over,Ross lays head on table): Hiiii!
Ross: We're fine, we're fine.
Ross: Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Ross: Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Ross: No, women are welcome to play.
Ross: Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Ross: No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
Ross: No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Ross: Oh, you're... (gives up)
Ross: Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because theydidn't look happy...
Ross: The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Ross: Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Ross: (pause)...Yeah.
Ross: Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me towin, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me tobe a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)
Ross: I'm not a nice guy.
Ross: Alright boys, let's eat.
Ross: You still on that?
Ross: You are way off, pal.
Ross: Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot anymore. I justI...
Ross: Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Ross: You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press thatbutton, you are in very, very big trouble.
Ross: Alright.
Ross: I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Ross: Alright.
Ross: So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteenbig ones.
Ross: Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Ross: So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to gothrough the formality of actually playing.
Ross: Uh... to the bathroom.
Ross: I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)
Ross: Alright. (to Rachel): Your money's mine, Green.
Ross: Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays downcards)
Ross: Oh, I am very in.
Ross: No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?
Ross: Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)
Ross: Show them to me!
Ross: Let me see! Show them!
Ross: First of all, I'm not losing...
Ross: Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Ross: (mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Ross: I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)
Ross: I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Ross: No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)
Ross: I'm in. (throws in chips)
Ross: One. (Rachel gives him the card.)
Ross: I bet two dollars. (throws it in)
Ross: I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)
Ross: (to Joey): Joey, I'm a little shy.
Ross: Fifteen.
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: (to Rachel): OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Ross: You got me.
Ross: Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, youknow. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)
Ross: Uh.... bean! Bean!
Ross: Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Goodboy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I seehe's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachelignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Really.
Ross: Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done withmen!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Ross: Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Ross: Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someonewho you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Ross: ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Ross: Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath.Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Ross: That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
Ross: 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna bethere.
Ross: I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someoneexactly like me.
Ross: Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking forsomeone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Ross: Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, shespent all day taking care of my monkey...
Ross: Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go overthere and, uh, try to woo her.
Ross: Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Ross: Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Ross: Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murdercapital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how wewere, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine)Well-
Ross: Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine) 
Ross: Oh, what? What-what?
Ross: ...Yeah?
Ross: (Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to dowas keep him in the apartment.
Ross: No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've,uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or apencil.
Ross: You called Animal Control?
Ross: Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed tohave him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Ross: That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to theapartment!
Ross: Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Ross: Cat!
Ross: My uncle Marcel.
Ross: Marcel?
Ross: Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He'sgone, he's-he's just gone.
Ross: Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks asign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot!Thank you very much.
Ross: Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcelany more!
Ross: Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sortof happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totallyoblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Ross: I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Ross: Oh, forget it, okay?
Ross: What? What?
Ross: Hi, did you order some bananas?
Ross: Gimme back my monkey.
Ross: Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Ross: Marcel! What've you done to him?
Ross: Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)
Ross: C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)
Ross: Okay, gimme my monkey back.
Ross: Alright, I want my monkey.
Ross: (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've beenfat.
Ross: It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcelresists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Ross: Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Ross: Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great....Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh,something grape?
Ross: Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off themain light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must bevacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh,not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and,um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Ross: We have got to start locking that door!
Ross: I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Ross: I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Joey and Ross: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Ross: Okay, okay, what's going on?
Ross: Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told toshove anything?
Ross: What? What? What?!
Ross: That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling,stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Ross: That's, that's nice twice!
Ross: What was with the dishes?
Ross: ...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Ross: You-you had what?
Ross: What, uh... what were you thinking?
Ross: No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Ross: It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples andoranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Ross: (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean Ihave things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keepingup with it. Okay?
Ross: Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: "Heating device."
Ross: Five letters.
Ross: I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Ross: Second date!
Ross: I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of alreadythrown caution to the wind.
Ross: Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-(Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-
Ross: What? It's, it's just a phase.
Ross: Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Ross: What?
Ross: (Mortified) Hi.
Ross: At the vet.
Ross: She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reachedsexual maturity.
Ross: She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Ross: I'm gonna have to give him up.
Ross: I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before youknow it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Ross: No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access tosome... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Ross: Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would beone of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just bea pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami,so that's a possibility.
Ross: What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's astealer.
Ross: Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Ross: (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To theothers) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know whothis is harder on, me or him.
Ross: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Ross: Where exactly is your zoo?
Ross: Yes.
Ross: No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Ross: Well I, I don't know. Why?
Ross: He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Ross: Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Ross: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Ross: Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Ross: Just, just say what you feel.
Ross: That was good.
Ross: Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Ross: Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sitsbeside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm reallygonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet tome, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay,Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for twoseconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Ross: Why, why, why would you dream that?
Ross: I love it, when we share.
Ross: I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Ross: Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Ross: Oh, it's my new beeper.
Ross: No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. Imean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Ross: College?
Ross: Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Ross: (on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, André is not here.(to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform thosekind of services.
Ross: (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right,JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'dbe a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye.
Ross: Oh, oh Chandler...
Ross: 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
Phoebe, Joey, and Ross: 'My scones.'
Ross: (on phone) Okay, André should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie,bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way.
Ross: Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Ross: You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Ross: Huh!
Ross: Are you not seeing him anymore?
Ross: Oh, yeah.
Joey, Chander, and Ross: Sorry.
Ross: It's morphin time!
Ross: Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she'shaving a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Ross: Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousinNathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Ross: I thought that was just a rumour.
Ross: Are you're hands still wet?
Ross: I'm here.
Ross: What? (his beeper goes off) Great, now I'm having a baby.
Ross: Ooh, Ooh.
Ross: I'm having... I'm having a baby. (jumps back onto the table again) I'mhaving a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Ross: I'm hurt.
Ross: Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
Ross: Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Ross: What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
Ross: Joey, get out of the fridge.
Ross: What is that? (refering to the sandwich)
Ross: Save it.
Ross: Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Ross: That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
Ross: She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's nothere.
Ross: I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed themucus plug.
Ross: God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Ross: She's not even here yet.
Ross: (to Carol) Where the hell have you been?
Ross: Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don'tstop for Chunkys.
Ross: Stopped for a Chunky.
Ross: (weakly) No.
Ross: Dr. Franzblau, hi.

Ross: I got itI'm getting it!
Ross: Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Ross: Breathe.
Ross: Breathe.
Ross: Breathe.
Ross: 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
Ross: Who the hell is Jordie?
Ross: No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name isJamie.
Ross: What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? Wenever landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylanfiasco.

Ross: (to Carol) Yeah, listen...
Ross: Please. This is so your fault.
Ross: Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Ross: You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Ross: Oh, I'm threatened by you?
Ross: Yeah, Susan.
Ross: I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks backwards as ifhe is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) Ow.
Ross: Help! Help!
Susan and Ross: (even louder) Help!
Ross: Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is allyour fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son isbeing born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
Ross: No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have,ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home withthe baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Ross: Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

Ross: Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not bearound, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this.(returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll stillalways come back, like this. (returns) 
Ross: No, this is pretty much it.
Ross: All right, I'll see you guys later.
Ross: And here's little Ben nodding off...
Ross: (quietly) That would be nice.
Ross: (overhearing) What kind of research?
Ross: Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued,they all look over)
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)
Ross: I'm going to China. 
Ross: Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, butthey don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them togive us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone forlike, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's myitinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it toMonica)
Ross: (to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show itto Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Ross: Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before Ileft.
Ross: Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?
Ross: No.
Ross: At the coffeehouse, right.
Ross: OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: (sigh)....I have to go to China.
Ross: No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys knowwho Carl is?
Ross: Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Ross: Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give herthis for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)
Ross: I know.
Ross: (something in Chinese)
Ross: Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)
Ross: I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Ross: Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Ross: Can't do it, can you?
Ross: I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Ross: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Ross: No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who caresabout them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninthgrade. 
Ross: I know.
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Ross: (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I bothknow we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are youattracted to me?
Ross: Well, start looking. 
Ross: Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Ross: No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Ross: Yeah. 
Ross: No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Ross: Come on, they're gonna love you.
Ross: (seeing her) Rach!
Ross: It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
Ross: You're bleeding. 
Ross: Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
Ross: That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is mysister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?
Ross: Everyone, this is Julie.
Ross: And bus.
Ross:  The screaming guy?
Ross: You gotta hear this story.
Ross: 200 at least.
Ross: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guesswho's in charge of the dig. 
Ross: Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see thebaby.
Ross: Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Ross: Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside thatkept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
Ross: It was you, pal.
Ross: Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. Butthen I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I neverwould've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Ross: I didn't order lemonade.
Ross: But...
Ross: Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
Ross: (on phone) Hello? Hi.
Ross: (on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sitsdown next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,three. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang upeither. 
Ross: Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Ross: Rachel! I'll just call her back. 
Ross: (calls Julie back) Hi?  Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)
Ross: Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
Ross: Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
Ross: (to Rachel) So, uh, he's back.
Ross: No, not a problem.
Ross: How's the hair?
Ross:  Yeah. (Gets up, but then pauses when he realizes what thatmeant.)
Ross: (entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on theshoulder which causes him to jump.)
Ross: What?
Ross: What?
Ross: Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Ross: I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)
Ross: Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Ross: Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Ross: Okay. (goes out onto the balcony)
Ross: What's goin' on?
Ross: Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of thosethings where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the nextday you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Ross: Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean IactuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with aguy like that. 
Ross: You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who getshow funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone whowakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someonewho makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. (Rachel has moved closer, but hearingthat she starts to back up.) Was there a second of all?
Ross: Okay.  Okay. (They hug.) Okay.
Ross: (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?
Ross: Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing inthe world.
Ross: This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd betterget used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just askquestions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Ross: Carol?
Ross: (enters) Hi, honey.
Ross: Hello to the rest.
Ross: (to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Ross: It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Ross: Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh,we play. It's like we're father and son.
Ross: My mommies love me. That's clever.
Ross: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it'sbreast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Ross: It's breast milk.
Ross: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Ross: No!
Ross: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Ross: I did not freak out. 
Ross: Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Ross: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't thinkbreast milk is for adults.
Ross: (jumping away) That would be no.
Ross: (staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Ross: Oh, you've tasted it.
Ross: (he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle andRoss squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes itoff.) 
Ross: (with a mouthful) That's not bad. 
Ross: I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Ross: Hey Mon!
Ross: Nope.
Ross: Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one ofRichard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Ross: Getting it away from me would be job one.
Ross: You need to get some sleep.
Ross: Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy,so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Ross: Hmm?
Ross: Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Ross: I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: What?
Ross: No.
Ross: Nope.
Ross: What?
Ross: Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Ross: Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, ashis prisoner, um, Princess Leia. 
Ross: Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was prettycool.
Ross: (entering with Monica in tow) Hey!
Ross: Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at aparking meter.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Guess what?
Ross: They published my paper.
Ross: How could you have told her? 
Ross: Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Ross: Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Ross: That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Whodid it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Ross: Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, yourgirlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Ross: Noo!
Ross: Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Ross: Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about thenight of five times? 
Ross: I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Ross: Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Ross: No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique,stamina, girth....
Ross: Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doingit. Do you wanna?
Ross: Nooo!
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Okay, okay, I'll go first.

Ross: Yes! 
Ross: Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Hmph.
Ross: With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
Ross: Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is thematter with you?
Ross: I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandlergoes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).
Ross: No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Momstanding where Rachel is)
Ross: I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking aroundand down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Why aren't you guys dressed?
Ross: No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door attwenty to eight. 
Ross: Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.

Ross: Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through thesame thing. And you know what I did?
Ross: I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. (Rachel starts tofollow Monica into her room, but Ross stops her and sends her back to her room.) There wego, there we go.

Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt inthere and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match.I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Ross: No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Ross: Thank you!
Ross: It was, it was her voice.
Ross: Yay!
Ross: No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Ross: Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it alittle, um.

Ross: Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I'vehad it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Ross: You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, isthe one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-Iwa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, whatcan I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Ross: Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
Ross: What?
Ross: Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, andhow much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Ross: I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake,with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. (starts to drink, but Rachel stops him justbefore he starts drinking)
Ross: You will?!
Ross: Well, yeah.

Ross: We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Ross: There it is.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it'sjust a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Ross: And it works both ways.
Ross: Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and shegives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Ross: (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option numberthree, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.

Ross: (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, butthere is something you can do.
Ross: Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room.Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder andthigh.) Okay, you're in bed...
Ross: I'm gonna use the cushion.
Ross: Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait forher to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her backover to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Ross: Yep.
Ross: Shoot.
Ross: Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Ross: What are you talking about?
Ross: What?
Ross: Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is thatguy's name? Dad!

Ross: Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. (singing) 'Areal American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
Ross: Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Joey and Ross: Go Joe!!!
Ross: (running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me, Joe!!! (hethen pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler'sdoor, dead.)
Ross: Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
Ross: Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can'tdeal with it, that's your 'too bad.'

Ross: Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sexwith celebrities.

Ross: Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list.
Ross: Yeah, maybe.
Ross: What you dont think Id go up to her?
Ross: Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Ross: Okay, hold my crawler.
Ross: (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Ima big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if Icould um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse youfor that one? 
Ross: Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding,um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so Im allowedto sleep with you. No, no, no, its flattery.
Ross: Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Dont, dont just dismissthis so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Ross: Um, yeah.
Ross: Um, no.
Ross: But, okay.
Ross: Um, see, but thats not the final draft.
Ross: Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler(Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumpedyou for Wynona Rider, local.
Ross: What?
Ross: (to the rest of the gang) Were just gonna be friends.
Ross: Im sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Ross: Yeah, Ill take some.
Ross: What?
Ross: Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sisterthat you dont live here anymore.
Ross: Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, shedoesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know thatyouve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Ross: (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
Ross: I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Ross: Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we werehaving so much trouble lately.
Ross: Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have anyclose friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susansomething, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference
Ross: No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I,no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
Ross: I dont know, something girlie.
Ross: (all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?
Ross: My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Ross: Cause Carols a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and Imnot one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation.
Ross: (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, manydrinks) Im an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and Id be out andshed, shed see some beautiful woman, and, and shed be Ross y'know lookat her, and Id think, God, my wife is cool!
Ross: Well, now I do!!
Ross: Seven years. I mean weve been together seven years, shes theonly woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever....
Ross: Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, orId paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I cant believe this!
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)
Ross: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Ross: Wait, wait, wait.
Ross: My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Ross: No, I cant get it out.
Ross: No, come on dont start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!
Ross: Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)
Ross: Oh well. It probably wouldve been the most constructive solution.
Ross: Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)
Ross: My wifes a lesbian.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: So I told Carl, Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are,nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur. But of course this went in one ear andout.....

Ross: I know.
Ross: Nothing I do means anything, really.
Ross: Well Mr. Big Shot is better than wethead.
Ross: Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in myfood.
Ross: Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Ross: Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Ross: Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.
Ross: Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, Icould be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, exceptthat I could pick your Father up and say Like me! Like me tiny doctor!

Ross: Why? Why cant you go to him?
Ross: Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happenedto die when you went to the dentist. Its, its, its just ah, acoincidence.
Ross: Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes upand kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?

Ross: Yes, thats what I was going to ask, thank you.
Ross: You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouthsDont worry, Ill be here the whole time. to Ross.) Yes! Thatdbe great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monicasarcastically mouths Yeah! and holds up her thumb.)

Ross: I know! Im saying you have to watch them all the time.
Ross: Monica did it?
Ross: Monica?
Ross: Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Ross: Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabetsong, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly hes leaving out eand f. Its like they just ah, I dont know, fell out of his head.
Ross: Oh, and also, hes, hes walkin kind of funny, his leftleg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and hes in there just sort ofy'know... (walks around in a circle) 
Ross: Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!
Ross: Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance!
Ross: He does not look happy.
Ross: Halftime.
Ross: What?
Ross: Um, Monica and I arent supposed to play football.
Monica and Ross: Yeah.
Ross: It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so shethrew her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdowndidnt count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nosebreaking.
Ross: Oh yeah! Then how come you didnt get the Geller Cup?
Ross: Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,nobody won that game,  and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophyand.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw itin the lake.
Ross: Anyway. Thats when our Mom said we were not to play football everagain.

Ross: Hey, whered you get that?
Ross: Its no surprise that your winning, cause you got to pickfirst, so you got the better team.
Ross: What?! The guys against the girls? See, thats ridiculous Monica,because Im only down by three touchdowns.
Ross: Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey youre with me.
Ross: Right. Okay, lets play. Lets go.
Ross: Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Lets play some ball,guys.
Ross: Okay, y'know what, lets just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi,which of my boys do you like?
Ross: Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to yourwindmill...
Ross: Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have notime, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Ross: Hey! Its 42-21!

Ross: How come its always us left in the field holding the ball?
Ross: Hey! Its starting to snow.

Ross: Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have tosell in order to win?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out hiswallet) How much are the boxes?

Ross: Well, that makes sense.
Ross: Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Ross: Hi, Im selling Brown Bird cookies.
Ross: No, hi, Im, Im an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Birdsalute.)
Ross: Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but Im not invited tosleep-overs.
Ross: No, please, please, um, its for a poor little girl who wants to goto Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
Ross: Okay, okay! Im going. Im going. (goes across the hall to knockon another door.)

Ross: Wait a minute, one box! Come on, Im trying to send a little girl toSpacecamp, Im putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Ross: No, but ah, theres coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell youwhat, Ill put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Ross: Mon?
Ross: Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes becauseyou ate them all. But ah, y'know Im sure thats not gonna happen this time, whydont I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of theRudolphs.

Ross: Ah, were out. I sold them all.
Ross: Monica, Im cutting you off.
Ross: Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Ross: Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Ross: Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as LaserFloyd was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!Thats when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies. So Iah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. Theycall me: 'Cookie Dude!'
Ross: Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Ross: Well you sure used a large font.
Ross: Sweetie, calm down, its gonna be okay.
Ross: What, that wasnt the great news?
Ross: (to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did yousell?
Ross: Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
Ross: Whats a scrud?
Ross: I dont have too. I can just look at you.
Ross: (to himself) Not nice enough.
Ross: (to himself) Good for a scrud.
Ross: Thats crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does thesalute)
Ross: Hi there!
Ross: Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious....nuget.... diffency.
Ross: Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year oldsister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Ross: Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousandinterviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) Thats not how that was supposedto come out.
Ross: That word was swans.
Ross: No. 
Ross: Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, andIm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting SarahTuttles Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jumpup, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered intinfoil.)
Ross: Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand byfor mission countdown!
Ross: Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joeyshead.)
Ross: Real magic does exist.
Ross: Ah, somebodys at the door on the ceiling.
Ross: Hey Chandler, theres a party tomorrow, youll feel better then.
Ross: Oh, somebodys feeling better.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Wow!
Ross: What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
Ross: And hes, hes a total stranger?
Ross: Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Ross: Well, Im just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoopin out of nowhere for no reason.
Ross: Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Ross: Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something aboutme?
Ross: Uh-huh.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Ross: Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, goodguy.
Ross: Thats excellent.
Ross: (to Rachel) So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Markdoesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (to Rachel) You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!(points to Chandler) This is men!!
Ross: Which one is Gina?
Ross: Thats okay.
Ross: Hey, Joey.
Ross: Ah, which, which one?
Ross: Mary-Angela.
Ross: Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. Hows it going. This is the hardest letterIve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hells a matter with you? How doyou think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with aletter?
Ross: All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay inperson. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela,okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let herdown easy.
Ross: Where in Cuba?
Ross: Bummer.
Ross: No, Im genuinely sorry the Mark thing didnt work out. Look,Rach, I want only good things for you.
Ross: But, you, you dont want to seem too pushy.
Ross: (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? Asin like, to, to his home?
Ross: Thats right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances atMonica)
Ross: That is so made up!
Ross: There you go.

Ross: What, now youre not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffeetable) Look Rachel, I-Im sorry, okay, Im sorry, I was out of my mind. Ithought Id lost you, I didnt know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insanemust I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I dont cheat right, I,thats not me, Im not Joey!
Ross: Y'know what, y'know what, Im-Im not the one that wanted that,that break, okay. Youre the one that bailed on us. Youre the one that, thatran when things got just a little rough!
Ross: Thats what?!

Ross: (entering) Hey guys!
Ross: Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totallybenign.
Ross: He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin...abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identifyit, he was reluctant to remove it.
Ross: At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Ross: (sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!

Ross: Im sorry.
Ross: Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it?part just another glance.
Ross: (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I dont, I dont, I dont haveto think about it, in fact, Ive decided, Ive decided that, that it.......does.
Ross: Oh, sure! Im sure.
Ross: Hey!

Ross: It does. It really and truly does.
Ross: (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!

Ross: Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she sayshere, (reading from the letter) If you accept full responsibility... (toChandler and Joey) Full responsibility! ...I can begin to trust you again. Does thatseem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!
Ross: (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, youre right. Yeah I guessIll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.

Ross: (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs.Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that youwere just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friendsmother.
Ross: Oh! Y'know, Ive got an extra futon.
Ross: Come on, I think this is a good thing. I dont think Momwouldve hired you if she didnt think you were good at what you do.
Joey, Rachel, and Ross: Hey!
Ross: The volcano?
Ross: With such a sad history.
Ross: So why dont you quit?
Ross: Who is Maria?

Ross: They make you take an oath?
Ross: Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta bestrong.

Ross: Good! Thats good!
Ross: Me? No.
Ross: Its okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)
Ross: No! And Im not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.

Ross: And thats not against your oath?!
Ross: Hello.
Ross: Wed like to close our accounts.
Ross: No-no.
Ross: No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.

Ross: So, uh, why did you have to turn it down? 
Ross: (moved by the kiss) Huh...

Ross: Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles,break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh... 
Ross: Oh, yeah, why not? 
Ross: You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? 
Ross: Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And insteadof a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end oftime, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and handsit to Joey who puts it on.) Here.

Ross: Hes taking her purse!

Ross: How sad are we?
Joey and Ross: Yeah!
Chandler and Ross: Yeah!
Ross: And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Ross: Hey! 
Ross: Im sorry Im late, did I miss anything?
Ross: 15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo andJoey mumbles, no!)
Ross: Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museumupstate.
Ross: Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near thedoor, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at mymercy.
Ross: No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. Sheseems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hoursaway.
Ross: Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Ross: You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Ross: Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decidebetween the two of them. Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes atwo hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But thisother girl, well, she lives right uptown. Yknow shes, wellshes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes notfun.
Ross: Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow? She lives soclose. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something thatwasif she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding,shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: I wasnt sleeping.
Ross: The one with the cat. I gotta go, Ive got another date.
Ross: No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was adifferent joke than I thoughtit wasnt that funny. So Im still torn.
Ross: Yknow, youre right. Thank you.
Ross: (waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sittingnext to him)
Ross: What?
Ross: (now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
Ross: Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Ross: What?
Ross: Uh actually Joey, its the Cretasous period.
Ross: My God!
Ross: Pheebs, youre talking about putting your body through an awful lot,I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and its all for somebody else!
Ross: Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Ross: That is really nicelying! No way is that the reason!
Ross: And youre afraid you wont be able tofill his shoes.
Ross: Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Ross: Just go for it Chandler.
Ross: Thats okay, Im cool over here. Ill catch up with youlater, Joey. (Joey is shocked.)
Ross: (entering) Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened inthe cafeteria today.
Ross: But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides neversit together.
Ross: Its like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Whereyou work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the otherchefs, right?
Ross: Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, herein the middle. Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hellsit with me.
Ross: Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is somethingunnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknowwhat I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people inblue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-thesecoats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.

Ross: Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and askedfor our check right away.
Ross: Thats okay. Shes still in there enjoying her fake party anduh, its too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
Ross: Yeah.

Ross: And why do you care so much?
Ross: You had fantasies about Emily?
Ross: Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with thatUkrainian kid?

Ross: So umm, any word from Susan?
Ross: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, Idont know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Ross: Yknow, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Ross: Am I?!
Ross: Am I?!
Ross: Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment,Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Yknow? Say-say theyrecoming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks,theyre laughing, yknow, someone innocently touches someone elseTheres electricity, its new. Its exciting. Are you telling me thereisnt even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Ross: OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
Ross: (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, sheand Susan are going to a poetry reading together! 
Ross: So! Poetry? Susans gay! Theyre being gay together!
Ross: Oh, wake up!
Ross: Excuse me?

Ross: Yeah!! Yeah!
Ross: I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at theairport, its-its so great. But at the same time Im thinking, "Well,Im gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Ross: Nothing! Theres nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here.I mean, she-shed have to uh, move here. She should move here!

Ross: What thing?
Ross: Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. Igotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) MyGod, think of the massacre.
Ross: Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Ross: Wait! It was my plan.
Ross: And, I came up with Atlantic City.
Ross: The paper.
Ross: Events from around the globe.
Ross: Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized
Ross: Yeah. 
Ross: Go ahead.
Ross: Wow. Umm Huh I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Ross: What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Ross: Why are you laughing?
Ross: Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wifesince the wedding.
Ross: Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know wheremy wife is. (Laughs) "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know! 
Ross: Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is
Ross: That is what the thing is.
Ross: No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's alwaysgreat when someone tells you they love you.
Ross: No thank you for Thank you.
Ross: Okay, let's go!
Ross: Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Ross: It's all right.
Ross: Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Ross: Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Ross: Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
Ross: Yeah, he's head of the department.
Ross: Hello.
Ross: Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Ross: To be fair, he doesnt seem to be impersonating Fonzie
Ross: Again, it's not that he
Ross: Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie orany of the Happy Days gang.
Ross: (entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Ross: Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
Ross: I do too! I do too!
Ross: Argh!
Ross: Argh!
Ross: You did it, man.
Ross: I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Ross: (on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy,old twit!
Ross: (on phone) Hello.
Ross: Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp andhands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily)Hi!
Ross: No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling!I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talkto me!
Ross: Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I reallymiss you.
Ross: (to the gang, whispering) She's talking.
Ross: (entering) Hi!
Ross: Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Ross: In London!
Ross: She wants me to move to London.
Ross: I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to Londonwith Ben.
Ross: It could happen.
Ross: All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to Londonwithout Ben.
Ross: Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonnamove here anyway, why can't you just do that?
Ross: Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a completeidiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here sowe can work this out.
Ross: All right, did you just say all right?
Ross: Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonnabe like-like-like two idiots in love!
Ross: Yes, tell me.
Ross: I know. I am, I am so sorry.
Ross: Again, very sorry.
Ross: Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
Ross: Oh that is so great! That's
Ross: So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Ross: No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Ross: I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposedto make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!
Ross: Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)
Ross: (entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is toodifficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up andstarts shaking a)
Ross: Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and loseone of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time beforeI'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I gotnothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then.Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads theanswer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads theanswer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Ross: For what?
Ross: Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check?I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Ross: It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Ross: Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Ross: No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without yourhelp.
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: (answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Lookumm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.(Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know whatshe said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time notknowing what's going on.)
Ross: (entering) Hey.
Ross: Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Ross: Damn!
Ross: I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Ross: Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see mywife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swigof Pepto Bismol.)
Ross: I have no idea. I mean But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Ross: So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Ross: Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked toEmily
Ross: What?!
Ross: Le Poo's still alive?!
Ross: Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Ross: Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there'sthis one thing Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn'tlooking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Rossnotices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!
Ross: You're nose is bleeding!
Ross: Umm (Rachel blows her nose.)
Ross: Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Ross: Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while nowand I really, I just have to get it out.
Ross: Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix mymarriage?
Ross: And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what shewants 
Ross: is for me not to see you anymore.
Ross: It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I wantmy marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. Butthe good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Ross: You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Ross: What are you doing?
Ross: Rachel, this is your apartment.
Ross: You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! Idon't know what to do.
Ross: Yes! Please!
Ross: That's okay.
Ross: That's not advice!
Ross: I'm going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)
Ross: (entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Ross: Hi.
Ross: I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm theone who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Ross: No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see theirsisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joeyat Burger King. So is, is that better?
Ross: Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would youdo?
Ross: I can't believe this is happening.
Ross: I am so sorry.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: How come? Everybody else does.
Ross: Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Ross: Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it'sEmily thinks we should get allnew stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Ross: Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Ross: Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York,I'm sure everything will be fine.
Ross: After what I did? Can you blame her?
Ross: (on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great.Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)
Ross: Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily andit looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Ross: Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a freshnew apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river onone side and Columbia on the other.
Ross: Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll getso much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Ross: (on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you.Bye. (Hangs up.)
Ross: No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
Ross: I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first stepsright over there. (Points.)
Ross: I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Ross: Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
Ross: Why?
Ross: What's going on?
Ross: Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guysgets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right,it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not alllaughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's reallife, okay? It's what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)
Ross: Yep.
Ross: Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Ross: Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Ross: Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Ross: You do, huh?
Ross: What are you talking about?
Ross: Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh It wouldreally mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Ross: Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
Ross: Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah,sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on.
Ross: Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)
Ross: Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Ross: (on phone) Hi.
Ross: (going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends,okay?
Ross: Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friendsout of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'llsee you're the only person I want to be with.
Ross: Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is nevergonna work if you don't trust me.
Ross: So, can you trust me?
Ross: Well, I guess that's it.
Ross: My marriage is over.
Ross: Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Ross: Emily's cousin kicked me out!
Ross: Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and thenyou get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
Ross: Who needs a lease when it's family!
Ross: You got it.
Ross: Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna getpacking again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Ross: What?
Ross: (entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!
Ross: Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I reallyappreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Ross: Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Checkthis out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross'svoice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!
Ross: Pretty cool, huh?
Ross: (glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)
Ross: (entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbsup, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)
Ross: I'll take sports.
Ross: All right. Uhh, international.
Ross: Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even thoughthere's never anything in here.
Ross: (looks) Oh yeah! You'rehey, you're right! Here's an affordableplace, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Ross: Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Ross: Okay, let's go.
Ross: Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip inon some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Ross: Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)
Ross: I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Ross: (To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Ross: (To Chandler) How about you?
Ross: All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs andfill out an application.
Ross: Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with myapplication.
Ross: Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at herplace for a while. So
Ross: Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Ross: Are you guys sure about this?
Ross: All right.
Ross: So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a painin the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay?And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the'quiet down' maneuver).
Ross: (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!
Ross: I couldn't possibly eat another bite. 
Ross: Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or myeviction? Hmm.
Ross: I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Ross: Oh God, no.
Ross: You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
Ross: In this life, Phoebe.
Ross: Yeah that's the same.
Ross: (entering) Hey! 
Ross: Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Ross: Oh, this is Monica.
Ross: Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgivingfood.
Ross: So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know sinceI've been away at college.
Ross: Well, that's cool. So did (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)
Ross: Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack werelooking for.
Ross: (in a high pitched voice) Monica!
Ross: So Im thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe playher that song we wrote last week.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, Im gonna be out with herall night.
Ross: All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Ross: Hey!

Ross: So uh, where's Monica?
Ross: Dude!
Ross: Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart.And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She playsfor both teams!
Ross: Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is!Severed toe, you just said it!
Ross: (To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
Ross: Well, they're not mine!
Ross: Why are they here?
Ross: (entering, depressed) Hi.
Ross: Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Ross: My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Ross: Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twiceand I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someoneate the only good thing going on in my life!
Ross: (quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I stillcan't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything. 
Ross: Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep yourmitts off my grub?"
Ross: (entering) Phoebe! 
Ross: Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, butpeople at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller,yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Ross: That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports forme, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough withpeople you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani,give me that coffee! Now!
Ross: Yeah, of course, Donald.
Ross: What?!
Ross: (Proudly) Yeah.
Ross: Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is allbecause of a sandwich.
Ross: Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Hersecret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it theMoist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here 
Ross: What?
Ross: You ate my sandwich?
Ross: (getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkeysandwich with a Moist Maker?
Ross: Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
Ross: (getting angry) That said it was my sandwich?!
Ross: (jumping to his feet in anger) What?
Ross: You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
Ross: (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
Ross: MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
Ross: (in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!
Ross: I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Ross: On account of my rage.
Ross: He gave me a pill for it.
Ross: Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave ofabsence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me atranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Ross: I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I,I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Ross: (entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?
Ross: (covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of thegang.)
Ross: Yeah, what's going on?
Ross: You slept with my sister?
Ross: This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)
Ross: My God Monica!!
Ross: Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would youdo that?!
Ross: I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy.(Theres nothing on the shelf.) Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. (Theresone lone tomato.) And top shelf: expired products. (The shelf is jammed packed.)
Ross: Because I am bored...Out of my mind. Ive already been to thebank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Ross: Hey, I am not unemployed. Im on sabbatical!
Ross: So what, we just sit?
Ross: I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make somethinghappen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, whatabout those Good Will Hunting guys?
Ross: Or that.
Ross: I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick toit. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. Theonly thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Ross: And it can't be Joey.
Ross: Or Joseph.
Ross: All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stopsreading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey,you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident!(Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) Theofficial rulebook of Fireball.
Ross: This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor notthe creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Ross: (To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs towork. (To Joey) Now come on! 
Ross: No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!(After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him theburn spots on his oven mitts.)
Ross: So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Monica and Ross: Sure.
Ross: Oh-oh, yeah.
Ross: Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Ross: Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Oh fine.
Ross: Joey's not going.
Ross: Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Ross: I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Ross: I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Ross: And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And ifyou were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Ross: If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Ross: How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now,no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
Ross: No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Ross: Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teachthem a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Ross: Yay!
Ross: I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you tofocus. Huh?
Ross: All right. (Takes another copy.)
Ross: Hey man.
Ross: About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
Ross: Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest(Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Ross: I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All rightJoey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry.
Ross: (reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler.
Ross: (hopping) 73! 72! 71!
Ross: What?
Ross: Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Ross: Awww, man! Really?
Ross: That's a good point.
Ross: Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Ross: All right.
Ross: Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got thehistory.
Ross: (To Phoebe) Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Ross: Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
Ross: Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. Iam gonna make myself happy.
Ross: Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. Thatmy friends is my New Year's resolution.
Ross: In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year withoutmaking fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Ross: Ohh.
Ross: Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!
Ross: I just asked that girl out.
Ross: Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her nameand phone number on it.)
Ross: That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

Ross: All right, see you later.
Ross: (entering, with Ben) Hi!
Ross: Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather storethat always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, (To Chandler) I neverreally owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
Ross: (after he's left) Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Ross: What are you, what are you doing?
Ross: What, to blind my child?
Ross: (talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's stillwearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot? 
Ross: Okay, it must just be me then.
Ross: That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if Iuse your bathroom?
Ross: Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without anotherword he heads into her bathroom.)
Ross: (in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Ross: 'Kay!
Ross: Oh my God!
Ross: (calling from Elizabeth's bathroom) Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Ross: Well, you can help me!
Ross: Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom
Ross: No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but theymust have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-Ican't put them back on. I can't!
Ross: Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.) 
Ross: Yeah, okay, hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread alarge amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. Itdoesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.)They're not coming on man.
Ross: Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Ross: Hold on.
Ross: They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and thepowder have made a paste!
Ross: What difference does that make?!
Ross: Dude, what am I gonna
Ross: All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Ross: I had a problem.
Ross: This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'ma loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Ross: Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)
Ross: Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Ross: Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some withfringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kissBen goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm acowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)
Ross: (disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I havea scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is gettingmarried! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Ross: Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it downon the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACKFOOD!!!!!!!
Ross: (entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Ross: No! No! No!
Ross: I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect andnow it's all covered in-in (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!
Ross: Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Ross: Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Ross: That's okay, Joe.
Ross: (licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!
Ross: Just, y'know out.
Ross: I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
Ross: Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can dowhatever I want!
Ross: Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
Ross: Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Ross: Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common!We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Ross: I am gonna see her again.
Ross: (entering) Hey guys!
Ross: Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day withJanice! 
Ross: Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening tome. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) Itis amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Ross: Thanks!
Ross: Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm onsabbatical from work, right?
Ross: Oh
Ross: This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First mymarriage falls apart and then
Ross: Okay. Sometimes I feel
Ross: Huh?
Ross: Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'mtoo whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you're saying, I've become so whiney thatI annoy you, Janice.
Ross: OHMYGOD!!
Ross: I am now.
Ross: Dude, we got to talk.
Ross: I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and Ihope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his reallaugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?
Ross: Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don'tuh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends orgirls they're related to.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: All right.
Ross: (walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.
Ross: Sorry.
Ross: (glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.

Ross: Is everything okay?
Ross: Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Ross: Your make-up!
Ross: What's the part, Anti-man?

Ross: What happened?
Ross: Wh-what did he say?!
Ross: Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you!I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!(Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You andme outside right now!" (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.
Ross: Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Ross: What kind of problem?
Ross: Nooooo!
Ross: Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Ross: Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Ross: It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Ross: Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe Inever realized how great it is!
Ross: (laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Rossquickly hurries out.)
Ross: (entering) What's going on?
Ross: What?! What?!
Ross: Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebestarts jumping to divert his attention.)
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting ithimself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Ross: No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him alittle bribe to 
Ross: No.
Ross: No.
Ross: A basket of mini-muffins.
Ross: The small one.
Ross: Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazyover those little muffins. It was the best day.
Ross: Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work!There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)
Ross: Noooo.
Ross: Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and noneof them even compares to that one!
Ross: Huh?
Ross: That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've beenwatching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see nowhe had the trampoline.
Ross: Well, he had gravity boots.
Ross: Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (Heopens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Ross: Right. (Exits.)
Ross: Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people whoapplied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'msorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud you.Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
Ross: A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from workover once it's y'know, furnished.
Ross: Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Ross: Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back towork. IWhat? (He notices something through the window.) No! Wh What are youdoing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Ross: Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stoppedby the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.)Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you weredoing to my sister! Now get out here!
Ross: What the hell are doing?!!
Ross: (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! Mybest friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Ross: (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugsthem both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Bignews!
Ross: What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against thedoor.) You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Ross: (happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was goingto react? (He hugs them both.)
Ross: Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids

Ross: No-no, it's not that, it's just I-I just moved in.
Ross: Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Ross: No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even metHoward. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Ross: Yes but too me he's just, man.
Ross: (To Phoebe) Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Ross: so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, andnow the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do?I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sitthem down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guywho-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Ross: It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Ross: Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gottarun. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)
Ross: Oh, no!
Ross: Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Ross: Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)
Ross: What are you doing?
Ross: You chipped in?!
Ross: Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it wastotally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Ross: Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Ross: (trying to get her attention) Phoebe?
Ross: (tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?
Ross: Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Ross: So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Ross: Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)
Ross: What?!
Ross: (trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!
Ross: Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Ross: Oh-no. No. No.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Ross: No, I will not!
Ross: You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Ross: This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a breakthing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one islaughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)
Ross: (To Rachel) Yeah, I still don't know. (To the salesman who is hoveringnearby) I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couchthat says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, (In a sexy voice) "Comehere to me!"
Ross: No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much asthe couch!
Ross: Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form andhands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of thecouch.)
Ross: Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it!Come on! Come on!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of thestore.)
Ross: What's that supposed to mean?
Ross: Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Ross: Yeah! Rach?
Ross: Then tell him quickly.
Ross: Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Ross: A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!
Ross: Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)
Ross: Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Ross: Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting therailing.)
Ross: Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head!You can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay.You got it?
Ross: Good-good-good.

Ross: Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Ross: Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) OkayRach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.) 
Ross: Oh, that's me.
Ross: No! That's-that's my arm!

Ross: Turn! Turn!
Ross: Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (Theystart up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot!Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Ross: Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
Ross: All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Ross: I can't believe that didn't work!
Ross: I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
Ross: That's what I'm telling you.
Ross: This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for onethat is not cut in half!
Ross: Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
Ross: (thinks) I take it.
Ross: Hey! What's up?
Ross: Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
Ross: Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you canpretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)
Ross: Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joeyjust stares at him) I'm Ross.
Ross: You got ink on your lip.
Ross: (to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!
Ross: (to the woman checking her mail) Who isn't? 
Ross: I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.

Ross: So uhh, you ready?
Ross: Sure. (He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.)Joey
Ross: (from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robotand waves at the cutouts.)
Ross: Hi!
Ross: (sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in thepark who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gaveus his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Ross: I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings
Ross: (from the bathroom) Okay!!
Ross: All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the bigaudition.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Ross: You're not his godfather.
Ross: (Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather.
Ross: Really? That's great!
Ross: Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. Imean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)
Ross: Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Ross: (entering, downtrodden) Hi.
Ross: Not so good.
Ross: (Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Ross: Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Ross: Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long!Later!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Yeah, it is.
Ross: No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Ross: Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: What's up?
Ross: Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
Ross: Well, you just
Ross: What?!
Ross: Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-youjust tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
Ross: What?!
Ross: And why wouldn't he get it?
Ross: Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Ross: Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Ross: You're kid's name is Raymond!
Ross: (entering, angrily) Joey!
Ross: (angrily) Ben! (Pause.) (Happily.) I mean, Ben! Ben!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Ross: No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Ross: Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because yousuck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Ross: I think, sub-consciously
Ross: (pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so thatBen would get the part.
Ross: No!
Ross: There you go. Thank you!
Ross: No.
Ross: Hey!

Ross: Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Ross: Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hittingon her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.

Ross: Gas? Wow! Intense.
Ross: (to Caitlin) Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Ross: They put that in.
Ross: The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's aleak.
Ross: A lot of other gas smells
Ross: Meth-methane smells
Ross: Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Ross: (To All) Was I talking to her about gas?
Ross: Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I willbe right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: What do you mean?
Ross: And she just gave you this?
Ross: Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Ross: Well that I can believe.
Ross: (To Phoebe) And she's supposed to buy this?!
Ross: Hm-mmm.
Ross: (sits down at the table) Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting marriedtomorrow. (Joey panics.) 
Ross: (turning and looking) What? Where?
Ross: What am I looking at?
Ross: Me too!
Joey and Ross: Yeah!!
Ross: Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!

Ross: So where are we going next?
Ross: Yeah, no one talks like that!
Ross: Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Ross: Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Ross: Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)
Ross: Yeah, no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)
Ross: Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just thereflashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Ross: What is it?
Ross: What? What? What? What is it?
Ross: Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Ross: (on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember thisfeeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay?Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)
Ross: Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in thecar
Ross: Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired.And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Ross: Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Ross: And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Ross: Wow! I could've died tonight.
Ross: I do have a newfound respect for life.
Ross: Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Ross: Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)
Ross: The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I hadan actual near death experience!
Ross: Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? 
Ross: And somebody took a shot at me!
Ross: No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebodywas taking a shot at me. And Rach, II survived! And I was filled with this-thisgreat respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize everyopportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Ross: (stares at her briefly) Okay, why are you here?
Ross: You talked to her?
Ross: Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Ross: Wow!
Ross: Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Ross: Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Ross: Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but myex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got tomean something!
Ross: You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed toseize! Y'know?
Ross: Huh.
Ross: That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-Ireally don't wanna see or talk to her.
Ross: Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Ross: Hey, thanks Rach. (They hug.)
Ross: Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it. 
Ross: (on machine) "Hey Ross, it's you!" (Hits the stop button) Ohyeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Ross: (looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monicahere?
Ross: Yeah, I want my money back.
Ross: Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Ross: I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-butheavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Ross: I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting allof us.
Ross: Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Ross: (he catches the ball and pauses, staring at Joey in disbelief) Also anisland.
Ross: (looks at his watch) 2:17.
Ross: Are you serious?!
Ross: Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Joey and Ross: No.
Ross: You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Joey and Ross: Yeah!
Ross: What-what is it?!
Ross: Why is it inside out?!
Ross: How much did you pay for that?
Ross: Yeah? How much?
Ross: ON A CAT??!!!!
Ross: Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a littlepolitical here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place tobuy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probablywon't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If youwant the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularlyscheduled programming.}
Ross: (To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see howlong we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Ross: What?
Ross: I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?
Ross: now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon theydiscovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws!How did it get there?!
Ross: How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Ross: Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Ross: 2 hours, 27 minutes.
Ross: Hey Rach!
Ross: Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Ross: (catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the sameteam!
Ross: It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
Ross: All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)
Ross: Baking it didn't help, huh?
Ross: I'm starving! 
Ross: I'm still hungry! 
Ross: I am!
Ross: Oh, thank God!
Ross: I know. My arm is killing me.
Ross: What's going on?
Ross: Oh God, here we go!
Ross: Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she likefreaks out. Watch! Watch! (He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)
Ross: Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? (Pokeshis eye)
Ross: All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
Ross: All right, bye!

Ross: All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
Ross: ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I didthat mad you so mad at me!
Ross: Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Ross: Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Ross: Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Ross: Yeah? Sometimes it's (Does the fist thing.)
Ross: Okay, I'm the baby. (Points at his eye.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: (entering) Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay,clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Ross: What do you like better flora or fauna?
Ross: Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?

Ross: What'd you say?
Ross: Is that supposed to be an insult?
Ross: So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Ross: Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)
Ross: (in his head) Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! Iam looking at this. (Looks back at his book.) Okay, vivid colors, expressive brushstrokesUnless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. Sheknows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonelytonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Ross: Hey.
Ross: May I come in?
Ross: Do you want me too?
Ross: So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takesoff his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.)This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise thequestion of "Us." (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks offhis left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)
Ross: The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)
Ross: Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-yournakedness?
Ross: You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Ross: No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the otherone and heads for the door.)
Ross: Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)
Ross: (sarcastic) Yep! That's hilarious!
Ross: Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Ross: Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Ross: What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Ross: Is that so?
Ross: (loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much youwant it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachelsinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)
Ross: (to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher whohad a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)
Ross: What the? What
Ross: Ohh, it was the best!
Ross: I think the check in is that way. (Points)
Ross: Phoebe! (They hug.) 
Ross: Hey, you wet my pants!
Ross: Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. (Points in the other direction.Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)
Ross: What?
Ross: Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
Ross: What? No-no, a lurker.
Ross: Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waitsfor you to give up and then
Ross: No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Ross: Uh-hmm.
Ross: My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dancekaratelessons.
Ross: Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop, then does alittle dance-type sway.)
Ross: What?!
Ross: Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
Ross: Joey!!
Ross: (To Joey) Thanks man.
Ross: Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Ross: Your what?
Ross: What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Ross: (on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to drawon my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you.(Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so. (Listens) I knowit's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway,umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing'sworked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens)Oh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up thephone) Yeah, it's not coming off.
Ross: Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So(Rachel stares at him.) Okay,look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget allabout it.
Ross: Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Ross: Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn'thave any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you.Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around andglares at him.) There are tonsoffreaks here. No other. No. Come on! No onewill notice, I swear!
Ross: Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
Ross: Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachelglares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridgeand pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one bigdrink! 
Ross: (looking at the price list) Umm Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Ross: Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Ross: (gets up) All right. Y'know what? We dont have to go downstairs! Wecan bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right, comeon, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.) 13.
Ross: (does so) Oohh, 23. (Rachel looks at him.) Which is what we play to atthis casino! You win 10 dollars! (Holds out a ten.)
Ross: You're right! (Gives her the twenty she won.)
Ross: (runs out of cards) We need more cards.
Ross: That must be our alcohol and beers! (Gets up to answer it.) 
Ross: Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey! (Hugs him.)
Ross: I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. (He starts tosit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it.Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Areyou, are you okay?
Ross: Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
Ross: (he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under thebed.)
Ross: I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, II really miss downstairs.
Ross: Well hello! I'm Ross!
Ross: Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here. (He points to thecorner of his mouth and they both laugh.)
Ross: (bowing) Hello!
Ross: Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
Ross: Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
Ross: Why are we in bed together?
Ross: (checks) Yeah.
Ross: No! But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we? I mean, I dontremember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Ross: And we didnt have sex. 
Ross: (getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has"Just Married" written on his back.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: What?
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: What?! Hello! We didnt get married.
Ross: We-we-weI remember being in a chapel.
Ross: IThey would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Ross: Laugh it up, but the jokes on you. Because we dont need to getdivorced, okay? We were just gonna get an annulment. 
Ross: What?
Ross: No-no, thats-thats not my thing! I do not love gettingdivorced!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that wholeannulment thing?
Ross: Im not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)
Ross: Yes, exactly!
Ross: Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk youinto this more.
Ross: Im-Im not kidding. Look I-I, I cant have threefailed marriages. I cant. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Ross: Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill someform out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the boxthat says Mrs.! Its right next to it!
Ross: Im asking you to do me a favor. 
Ross: And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may makeyou want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get tokeep all the presents!
Ross: I dont know if its true.
Ross: Oh, okay, yknow what this is? This is a difference ofopinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Ross: All right. All right, Ill do it.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, yeah, no problems. Its all taken care of.
Ross: Oh yeah, why not?
Ross: Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Ross: I didnt get the annulment.
Ross: Were still married! Dont tell Rachel. See you later. (He getsup leaving Phoebe in shock.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, yeah, no problems. Its all taken care of.
Ross: Oh yeah, why not?
Ross: Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Ross: I didnt get the annulment.
Ross: Were still married! Dont tell Rachel. See you later. (He getsup leaving Phoebe in shock.)
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey, do you have any gum?
Ross: I know.
Ross: Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyers office all I could hearwas, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just dont want my tombstoneto read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Ross: Look, all I know is I-I cant have another failed marriage!
Ross: Well, okay so, I dont have it all worked out quite yet. Justdont say anything to Rachel, please?
Ross: Hey! Hi!
Ross: Whats up?
Ross: Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friendshaking up. Oh,thats great. Thats great. (Kisses and hugs her.)
Ross: Bye.
Ross: Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is anembarrassment! I should go live under somebodys stairs!
Ross: (interrupting) No! No, I wont! Ill be at the bottom of thedating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy,and-and, Geologists.
Ross: Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Ross: What?! Why?
Ross: And if you wait right here, Ill go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his armand prevents him from escaping.)
Ross: once you know the stories, its not that bad. First marriage,wifes hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at thealtar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldnt allow you to getmarried when youre that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevadasfault.
Ross: What?!
Ross: This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have lovedher in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help meout here?
Ross: We were drunk! I wouldve married uh, Joey with that amount ofalcohol!
Ross: (to the panel) Look, Im sorry, but you guys are wrong. I justdont want to be divorced three times.
Ross: (getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget aboutthe whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-Ill go to my lawyers office right nowand get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth(leansdown to Megs ear)Nothing!!
Ross: Yes.
Ross: Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Ross: Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
Ross: Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Ross: This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Ross: I think just the annulment for today.
Ross: Easy.
Ross: No problem.
Ross: Ooh! Theres no way to do this without her? Cause I kinda allready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Ross: Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.)I will think about the therapy.
Ross: Oh no.
Ross: I couldnt.
Ross: Its not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I
Ross: I I do, I do not love Rachel. Im gonna tell her right nowabout the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay?Would I do that if I loved her?
Ross: I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)
Ross: Ohh, whats wrong?!
Ross: Oh myCome here! Come here! (He hugs her.) Its okay.Everythings gonna be okay.
Ross: Of course.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
Ross: No. 
Ross: I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out soI eh, didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset.I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
Ross: Its nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Ross: Its also a sign of friendship.
Ross: (grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!
Ross: S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Ross: I was hugging her as a friend. Its not my fault her-her hair got inmy face, shes got a lot of it and it smells all-all uhcoconutty. (Phoeberaises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesnt mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybeit means I have feelings for coconuts!
Ross: (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being inlove, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Ross: Okay, theres this guy, Warren, from the museum and hes goingon a dig for like two years and hes got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh,you interested?
Ross: Dont thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano thaterupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.(Rachel just looks at him.) Heres Warrens number.
Ross: Okay, you go grab it!
Ross: I dont know what youre talking about.
Ross: Look, I do not re-love her.
Ross: Look, were just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Ross: You can live with me.
Ross: What?
Ross: Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)
Ross: Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.
Ross: Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right.
Ross: Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) Youre gonna say things now,arent ya?
Ross: Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Ross: What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre stillmoving in right?
Ross: What?! Over a stupid room!
Ross: Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!
Ross: Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over aroom?! I mean, that is so silly!
Ross: Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two peopleI care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of thesilliness!
Ross: (stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look Ive known youboth a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy asyouve been since youve got together. Do you really want to throw that all awayover a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Ross: Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Ross: And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?
Ross: (jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!(Storms out.)
Ross: (entering) Hey Rach!
Ross: Youre never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving inagain. Thats great news rightI mean for them. Right?
Ross: Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Ross: Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Ross: No!
Ross: No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are youstill in that place?
Ross: Good! Me neither! So its not a problem. Were just two friendswho happen to be roommates.
Ross: Really?! We are?
Ross: Ohh! That would be great.
Ross: (laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didnt think ofthat.
Ross: So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean its a reallybig step! And-and whats the rush?!
Ross: No, I-I-Im serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, youstart fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing yknow you break up!
Ross: Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isnt about the room, this isabout what the roomrepresents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachelsroom) could destroy you!!
Ross: Fine! Its your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failedattempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one lasttime.) I just dont want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if youmove in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but thats what you want,theres nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DONT DOIT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)
Ross: (To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?
Ross: Fighting?!
Ross: Yeah. Theres no breaking them up, is there?
Ross: Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)
Ross: Yeah, Im-Im sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before Ichange my mind. (She exits)
Ross: Ive been back and forth.
Ross: Ehh, I dont, I dont think so. Shes already talked aboutyknow, dating other guys.
Ross: Yeah, well, m-maybe youre right.
Ross: Is that what I want?
Ross: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Ross: How weird is that? Yknow? Youre moving in with me and have theone thing I dont have. Its like uh, in a way you-you complete me(Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.
Ross: (in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!
Ross: What?
Ross: OhmyGod! I-I see what this is! You are in love withRachel!
Ross: Of course! It all adds up! I mean you youre obsessed with her.Its always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross,why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secretmarriage to Rachel?" You want her!
Ross: (answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?
Ross: (on phone) No-no-no, thats great! Ill be there Monday. Andthank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, that was the head of thePaleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Ross: Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate,huh? They loved it. 
Ross: I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean itstemporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would thatlook great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Ross: (entering) Hey everyone!
Ross: Hey uh, well, todays my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try itout on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Ross: (he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly)"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of thesetheories can be further subcategorized into two distinct"
Ross: (continuing) "subcategories. The first of these subcategoriesis"
Ross: No! Why?
Ross: Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) "Thereare three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.(Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each ofthese theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler)into"
Ross: Open with a joke? Its a university, not a comedy club!
Ross: (gets up) Okay!
Ross: Thank you!
Ross: Please dont say naked chicks.
Ross: I-I-I dont even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it.Yknow what? Im just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Ross: (entering) Hello!
Ross: It went great! And I didnt need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Ross: I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.Everyones all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved themwrong! And now, Im gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Ross: Thats right!
Ross: (to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from thelaboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in factsedimentary. Imagine his consternation when(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.
Ross: Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring!I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this Britishaccent just came out.
Ross: Will you-will you please?
Ross: Oh.
Ross: (in his British accent) Im sorry, Ive got plans with mysister.
Ross: (in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monicaaside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?
Ross: Just please stop!
Ross: (entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have tospeak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Ross: Theyre not listening too me?
Ross: Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Ross: (in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out,phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronouncedthe British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors intheir carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (Onestudent raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)
Ross: (British) Come again? Whats-whats this nonsense? (Giggles.)(American.) All right, Im-Im not English. Im from Long Island. I wasreally nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. Im sorry. So, if we could justget back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands)About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying tomake a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me isreally important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here. So if youjust give me another chance to make a good impression
Ross: (in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!
Ross: Look I was going to tell you!
Ross: Okay, maybe it wasnt my best decision. But I just couldnt faceanother failed marriage.
Ross: Rach, come on, if you think about it, its actually kinda funny. (Helaughs, and he laughs alone.) Okay, maybe its best not to think about it.
Ross: Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Ross: Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all theforms. Ill take care of everything.
Ross: Okay Rach, but
Ross: Look I told you
Ross: Look, if youd had two failed marriages, youd understand!
Ross: What about the time I said we were on a break?
Ross: Fine, Im mentally unstable.
Ross: What?!
Ross: Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!
Ross: Oh, come on!
Ross: Okay, Im sorry, this is insane! I-I-Im not addicted to heroin,Im not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything!Look, Ill consummate this marriage right here, right now!
Ross: And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Ross: (stands up) Thats great! Are you happy now? Look what you did withyour funny, funny form!
Ross: And what(notices the stenographer is still typing)What are youtyping that for? Did you hear what she said? We dont get the annulment. Donttype that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and inthe process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (Hes still typing.)Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Ross: That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Ross: The judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get adivorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)
Ross: I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, Ive already signed everythingand I put little Xs where you need to sign.
Ross: Yknow, I-Iyouve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Ross: Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about youtold me you loved me after I was already married!
Ross: Yeah! Right!
Ross: Youre right. Thats very different. So lets, letsjust sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?
Ross: Okay, can we just sign please?
Ross: Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)
Ross: What?
Ross: Excuse me?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: So then if-ifI mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) yourfault.
Ross: Ive got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought Iwould be divorcing you.
Ross: Did I, did I even treat?
Ross: That may be the most depressing thing Ive heard in my life. I shouldprobably get these to my lawyers office.
Ross: Eh, no problem.
Ross: Totally. (Exits.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guyswould come over and watch it.
Ross: I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Ross: Oh, but-but I cant do it.
Ross: Because, because Ive got Ben.
Ross: Of course he is! What, do you think Id just use my son as-as anexcuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
Ross: (to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Ross: Oh, Im just over here with Ben. I thought wed say hi.
Ross: Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he hascreated out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesnt feel like talking right now.Hes smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Ross: (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, hows the packinggoing? (Listens) Ben? Hes fine. Yeah, hes rightOh my God! (He looks overat the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirtthere son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah,its a pumpkin. Ill come pack.
Ross: And now you want that money back.
Ross: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up thefake Ben.)
Ross: Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Ross: Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, Id be glad to playyou for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Ross: No.
Ross: So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll becomputers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. Sotheoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-andlive forever as a machine.
Ross: Hi! (Rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)
Ross: So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
Ross: Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Ross: Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can'tdate her.
Ross: Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster everynight before she went to bed.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: (enters) Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So,Mondler...uh, what uh, what cha doin?
Ross: Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Ross: Put it back exactly where you found it?
Ross: Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
Ross: Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
Ross: Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to moveback in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Ross: Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right.Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freakout. Oh my God,she's going to sit on you.
Ross: Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. (Chandler fixes it and a pictureframe off the table.) And that goes back up there.
Ross: Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Ross: Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back ofthe carpet.
Ross: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in theseating area.
Ross: Hey, I've been married 3 times
Ross: Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Ross: Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either.After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh" 
Ross: Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Ross: Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
Ross: They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Ross: (nonchalantly) I'm never gonna find love again.
Ross: Who cares? I repel women.
Ross: (whispers) What?!
Ross: Why does anyone have to be naked?
Ross: I-I had to show Chandler something?
Ross: Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Ross: Dude, what'd you have?
Ross: (realizes something) The photo album! There were millions of pictures ofthe apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to thepictures.
Ross: So really, what'd ya have?
Ross: Bye! (Runs out)
Ross: So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry outthe same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could downloadour thoughts and our memories into this computer...
Ross: That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing rightnow? You and I, we're interfacing.
Ross: Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Ross: The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Ross: Still I could tell. She was into me. (Joey rolls his eyes.) Well, whydont you set us up?
Ross: Maybe its a universal thing?
Ross: Hey guys.
Ross: Whats up? (He smiles. His teeth are freakishly white.)
Ross: I whitened them.
Ross: Yeah. What do you think.
Ross: Come on, seriously.
Ross: Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
Ross: A-A day.
Ross: I know. Thats why I did it. (With a big smile) Come on, are they reallythat bad?
Ross: Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh
Ross: I dont know what Im going to do. That date starts in like anhour.
Ross: Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Ross: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Were not 13 anymore.
Ross: But, wont she notice I have makeup on?
Ross: What??
Ross: No. I am not putting on makeup. (Knock at the door. Phoebe enters.)
Ross: Mmm-Hmm.
Ross: Mmm.
Ross: Mm-Hmm.
Ross: (Chuckling) Hmm-Hmm.
Ross: Mmm-Unmm.
Ross: Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Putting his hand up to block his mouth.) Okay. I, uh, am fromLong Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in myspare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, lets talk more about you. Hmm.
Ross: Mmm.
Ross: (Giggling) Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.)Me, neither. Ive had a really good time too, you know. (Putting the bread down.)
Ross: (Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh, I just like the smell. (Sniffingit.) Mmmm.
Ross: Hmm-Hmm.
Ross: Mmm-Hmm. (Picking up their wine glasses.)
Ross: (Covering his mouth with the glass.) How about all the way.
Ross: (Looking at the posters.) Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster?(They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) So,ahh, where were we?
Ross: Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Ross: I-I, did that for you.
Ross: Whats a matter with me? Youve got a black light. Its 1999!
Ross: (only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!
Ross: (not paying attention) Yeah, they dont like you.
Ross: I dunno, maybe its because youre really sarcastic. Or maybeits cause you uh-
Ross: (trying to act manly in front of Janine) No I dont want toplay video games, Joey!
Ross: For real?
Ross: Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because its mysister. But, uh, uh yknow actually, growing up with a sister was nice because itreally helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Joey and Ross: Hey!
Ross: And the place looks so nice!
Ross: Happy Thanksgiving!
Ross: See ya!
Ross: Oh, oh, we did say wed stop by this little thing Joeysroommate is having.
Ross: Some would say shes attractive, yes.
Ross: (to Joey) Dude, we were good!
Ross: Oh, but-but it is, uh, its just like the first Thanksgiving, whenthe Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Ross: Yeah, yeah, what is it?
Ross: W-What was the one right before bananas?
Joey and Ross: (faking dissapointment) Okay.
Ross: Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
Ross: Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Ross: Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...SheperdsPie!
Ross: No, no, we will. We just wont tell her she messed up.
Ross: Yeah, itll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Ross: (worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Ross: Okay, I think I might know why my parents dont like you.
Ross: Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I gothigh in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you hadgotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Ross: I dont know, aheh, yours was the first name that-that poppedinto my head, Im Im sorry. I-I didnt think it would matter.
Ross: How was I supposed to know wed end up being friends after college,let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Ross: I dont know, I-I was all high. 
Ross: Okay, okay, Ill tell em it wasnt Chandler who got high.Now who should I say it was?
Ross: Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Ross: Okay, fine!
Ross: Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. Noit cant? Okay.
Ross: What?! What is with everybody? Its Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Ross: Okay, okay, well just get everyone to act like they like it.That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!(Referring to the dancers.)
Ross: Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Ross: So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm? 
Ross: And um...You look nice today.
Ross: What?
Ross: (shocked) Eh?
Ross: (cutting her off) Youre alone.
Ross: (just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, cant blame aguy for trying!
Ross: Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. Helooks like hes going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler hassome left.
Ross: It tastes like feet!
Ross: Are you kidding?
Ross: Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing aletter.
Ross: Wha-what?
Ross: (in a 5 year olds tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom,Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Ross: Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me.Im sorry.
Ross: Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didnt break the porch swing, Monicadid!
Ross: Monica and Chandler are living together!
Ross: I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Ross: Hey
Ross: Wow, Monicas letting other people help decorate her tree! Didsomeone get her drunk again or?
Ross:  and thats the story of the dreidle. Now, some peopletrace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches intotheir huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising lifes triumph over death.And that was like 4000 years ago.
Ross: I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot,but now shes like OLD NEWS!
Ross: Hi Janine!
Ross: Youre gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Ross: Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in TimesSquare is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not alot of people know that.
Ross: Are you serious?
Ross: Bye Janine!
Ross: It was a dry day.
Ross: Oh my God!
Ross: Got it!
Ross: Oh my God its just like I dreamed it!
Monica and Ross: Scuse us
Ross: Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Ross: Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Ross: Why do they keep doing that?
Ross: Right.
Ross: Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: We know!
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Monica! (Pause) Would it?
Ross: Hey, I know whatll get us up on a platform!
Ross: The routine!
Ross: Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, hell wanna buildus our own platform!
Ross: We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category!Look, its almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Ross: So, do we really have to ask whos going up on the platformnext?
Ross: Can you believe this? Were gonna be on the platform for theMillennium moment!
Ross: No!
Ross: Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goindinto the robot, yknow? (He mimics a robot)
Ross: I dont know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, strongerback then.
Monica and Ross: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Ross runs to be caught byMonica, but she moves out of the way)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: You kissed her.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: You like it? 
Ross: Its my new apothecary table!
Ross: Well why not?! Shell-shell love it! Its the real thing!I got it at Pottery Barn.
Ross: Why did you do that?
Ross: She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Ross: What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from PhoebeOoh, although I didget some great Pottery Barn sheets! (Gets them.)
Ross: Uh, yeah! I still cant believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Ross: Yeah but Pottery Barn! Yknow what I think? Its justshe-shes weird. Yknow its because shes a twin. Twins are weird.
Ross: Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new(OnRachels glare)old sheet?
Ross: My apothecary table!!!
Ross: I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Ross: Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks forwrecking my sheet by the way.
Ross: Wow! I didnt know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
Ross: A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that!The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Ross: (glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.
Ross: Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some othertime periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)
Ross: Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, yknow what? Since you have such a greatsense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you takePhoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Ross: She does want to.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Yknow what would cheer you up?
Ross: Im giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I thinkyou should come.
Ross: Hey, youre not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent itin to Playboy. They printed it!
Ross: Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. Its notjust about the pictures.
Ross: (showing them the page) Here, check it out. Its the firstone, too.
Ross: What?
Ross: Uh, oh-oh, no you didnt. I did.
Ross: Hey, tell Dan, Thanks.
Ross: What?
Ross: Look, Chandler, its my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel anybetter they dont print the name, so it doesnt really matter who gets credit,right?
Ross: No, its my joke, its mine. You can call them, theylltell you.
Ross: Its my joke.
Ross: You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Ross: What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Ross: Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is whyhe sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Ross: Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill showthe sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Ross: Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Ross: Well, Im not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).
Ross: (showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check thisout.
Ross: Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Ross: Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Ross: Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still havent gotten it.
Ross: Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Ross: Its my joke.
Ross: Yknow, I dont think were going to settle this.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Hey Mon.
Ross: Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah, but Im your brother. Were family. Thats the mostimportant thing in the world.
Ross: Well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decidewhich one of us is telling the truthme. 
Ross: See, I would never snap at you like that.
Ross: Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution?Monkey into man? Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey. Im Doctor Monkey!
Ross: Its your joke.
Ross: No way. 
Ross: Hey Joey, how come our stuff isnt free?
Ross: Hey does anyone have any gum?
Ross: Yknow what? Im good! Im good!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: When you put a D at the end of Fine yourenot fine.
Ross: Hi Jill.
Ross: Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away yourcredit card.
Ross: I dont think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as makingit on your own.
Phoebe and Ross: Yeah, we went shopping!
Ross: Sorry-sorry Jill.
Ross: Huh? Oh, I got this(Holds up this pink frilly thing)this!
Ross: Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Ross: Ross, wants a pajmena?
Ross: Its a rug. (Jill winces.)
Ross: Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)
Ross: Well. Hey
Ross: Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) "Imsorry!"
Ross: Oh stop.
Ross: No, you stop!
Ross: (entering) Rach? Hi!
Ross: Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Ross: Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I wouldnever have thought of going out with her, never!
Ross: Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Ross: I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after allweve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Ross: (entering) Hi Jill!
Ross: Hi (sees Rachel and forgets her name for a moment).
Ross: Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home,youre-youre-youre right here.
Ross: Okay. So well Ill umm, (To Rachel) Ill have her home bymidnight.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Ross: I guess so.
Ross: No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of myfavorite fossils.
Ross: Something couldve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides.And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Ross: Anyway, if she, if she wasnt in to me, why-why would she ask me outagain?
Ross: Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentines Day, the most romantic dayof the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her myslides, if you know what I mean.
Ross: (while Rachel is finishing her rant) Okay! Okay! Okay! Its okay.(Rachel stops.) Its okay. Hey, its too weird for you, I wont see heragain.
Ross: I mean after tomorrow night.
Ross: Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! Ill-Ill tellher tonight I cant see her anymore.
Ross: You want me to call her right now?
Ross: Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Ross: Hey! Uh, Phoebes not here is she?
Ross: And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead ofhim to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didnt know he was in there. (Theyall kinda look at him.)
Ross: Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Ross: You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to (Opens thedoor to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-thats just a little gameI play with the kids down the hall. Umm, theyve really taken a liking to me.(Quickly looks out to see if theyre watching.) Uhhwhats-whats-whats the matter?
Ross: Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)
Ross: Okay, umm
Ross: What?
Ross: Wow! Really?!
Ross: Well, Id love to! Here, you wait right here and Ill go get theprojector and my notes!
Ross: Ohh!
Ross: Slides are almost ready.
Ross: Uh okay, well theres-theres wine in the kitchen.
Ross: (answering it) Hello?
Ross: O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-shes really upset werejust talking.
Ross: So thats the only reason she could be here huh? It couldnthave anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I puton a great slide show!
Ross: Yknow what? I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to youlater. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.)Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that youre just using me.
Ross: (To Rachel) You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Ross: Umm, she kissed me.
Ross: Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Ross: Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didnt stop it.I guess I-I just wasnt thinking
Ross: Oh waithold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped thekissing.
Ross: Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothingcould ever happen with us!
Ross: No, I mean, look I dont know if anything is going to happen with us,again. Ever. But I dont want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and shegot mad and broke my projector.
Ross: Youre welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)
Ross: You take care Jill.
Ross: I know what you mean, Ive always wondered how different my lifewould be if-if Id never gotten divorced.
Ross: The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadnt realized shewas a lesbian.
Ross: Id bet Id still be doing my kara-tay. (Thats karate,hes just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot ofkara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow, not doing anything elsephysical.
Ross: No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Ross: What?!
Ross: Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, wed stillhang out?
Ross: (recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Ross: No-no. Its-its me, Ross!
Ross: No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Ross: Yeah. Right.
Ross: Good-good, Im-Im married. (Shows her his ring.)
Ross: Is-isnt it the best?
Ross: Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually shes right down thestreet, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Ross: Yeah? Oh-oh, shed be so excited!
Ross: Come on! (They start to leave.)
Ross: No, its okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but Idont
Ross: (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.
Ross: Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, hereyou go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay, lets go see Monica!
Ross: Hey Mon! 
Ross: Mon, look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)
Ross: And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)
Ross: And thats Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)
Ross: (answering it) 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahonsparty. I played you one of my songs, yknow Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Ross: Sometimes, you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime!Ill play you one of my other
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over heresometime!
Ross: Come on Pheebs, its not that bad! Yknow most people would beexcited if they didnt have to work for a couple of weeks.
Ross: Well umm, Ive been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Well, last weekend
Ross: will be two months
Ross: since I stopped trying.
Ross: What-what do you mean?
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Wow!
Ross: Okay, I think I got it.
Ross: So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the showerthere.
Ross: Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice thingsup a little.
Ross: Carol our sex life isits just not working
Ross: Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why dont we get some shoes onya, huh? Hey, why dont you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!Yay!!
Ross: Yay! (To Carol) Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe Idont know, we could try some-some new things. Yknow? For fun?
Ross: Well I dont know umm, (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up?(Carols shocked and obviously doesnt like that idea.) Umm, some people eatstuff off one another. (Carol doesnt like that idea either.) Nah! Umm, yknowwe-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm, we could, we could have athreesome.
Ross: Come on. (Helps her into bed as her phone rings.) I got it.
Ross: I got it!
Ross: (on the phone) Hello? (Listens.) No she cant come to the phone rightnow. (Listens.) Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye. (Hangs up.)
Ross: J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that youwere getting better.
Ross: (To Monica) Yeah, shes fired.
Ross: So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonnastart to find
Ross: Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips toanother page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well, someonesbeen doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)
Ross: Oh, I know. (Laughs) Yknow, just-just talking about it is getting mekinda
Ross: Yeah? Well, I-I think Bens asleep.
Ross: Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
Ross: Hey, Pheebs!
Ross: Hey, hows it going?
Ross: She doesnt know she was fired yet, does she?
Ross: Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that youshould start think about getting a different job.
Ross: Were really gonna do this, huh?
Ross: Yknow, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back outat (A knock on the door interrupts him.)
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Im-Im Ross by the way.
Ross: How hot is this?!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Look at you! Youre up!
Ross: Hey Joe did Did you ever have a threesome?
Ross: No! The reason Im asking is that I sorta had one last night.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: It was, it was okay.
Ross: Look, its just did, did you ever go to a party and think,"Would really anyone miss me if I werent here?"
Ross: Oh-oh, absolutely!
Ross: Its just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, andthen there was a lot of waiting around.
Ross: Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Ross: No, she kept kicking me away!
Ross: No!
Ross: Oh I a lot of stuff!
Ross: A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Ross: Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard
Ross: It really was!
Ross: Hey Rachel.
Ross: Umm, no.
Ross: That-thats always good news. Are you okay?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Okay. (He does so.) 
Ross: Were sorry.
Ross: Didnt you spend last night at Joeys?
Ross: Look I-I dont know whats going on with you and your husbandand what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Ross: Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make theirmarriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wivesengage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman shebarely knows from the gym!
Ross: Men. I guy I know.
Ross: She is not (Realizes) Shes gay. Oh my God. She is sogay! I cant believe this.
Ross: Im sorry your husband cheated on you.
Ross: Try telling my wife that.
Ross: Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Ross: Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Ross: Whats up with the greed Joe?
Ross: Well isnt there something you can do to earn a little extra money? Imean, cant-cant you pick up, I dont know, an extra shift here?
Ross: Oh, wait! Wait! Dont you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybeyoull get that job!
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Ross: Wow!
Ross: After one class? I dont think so.
Ross: Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming,thats not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and theres aconcept you should really be familiar with. Its what the Japanese call (he holds twofingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.
Ross: No, its a concept!
Ross: All right, maybe it means that too
Ross: Yknow what? Fine! Get attacked! I dont even care! 
Ross: Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagican you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Ross: (moves closer) All Im saying is, its one thing being preparedfor an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, Idont know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachels and screams) surprise!!
Ross: All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesnt mean youhave unagi. (Does the finger thing.)
Ross: Yknow what (Moves away as Chandler enters, panicked.)
Ross: No.
Ross: So what are you gonna do?
Ross: DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Ross: A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thingevery time now.)
Ross: Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screamswould you have begun to kick my ass?
Ross: Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, butIlook, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbageand Ross screams) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.)Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Ross: (not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Ross: Unagi. Im always aware.
Ross: Whats up?
Ross: Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes.
Ross: Yknow what? Shed-shed love this. (Picks up a model ofthe Saturn V rocket, thats the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, its anexact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Ross: Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon. Butyou-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and returnsafely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read theChristmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took thefamous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)
Ross: Why not?
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Its not something you are! Its something you have!
Ross: Yknow what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance youcan get very, very hurt!
Ross: Its a great class.
Ross: Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.)Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where thewoman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Ross: No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Ross: Yes thats right.
Ross: I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Ross: No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Ross: Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldnt. Thats why Imhere. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-thats a no.
Ross: Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)
Ross: DANGER!!!!
Ross: Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this onestudent wrote, "I loved Dr. Gellers class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller,you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Ross: Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Its a girl! Anyway, it wouit wouldnt matter. Okay?Because Im a teacher and shes a student.
Ross: No, but it is frowned upon.
Ross: Besides, theres a big age difference.
Ross: I know when Im 90 shell be like 80 and it wont seem likesuch a big difference.
Ross: (startled) Yeah?
Ross: Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on athumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)
Ross: That was you?
Ross: Oh I, I dont-I dont think that would be the best idea.
Ross: What time?
Ross: Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)
Ross: Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Ross: What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Ross: Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyones name, so I-I kinda cameup with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Ross: Umm, no. No.
Ross: Umm, its Cutie McPretty.
Ross: Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-Im having a great time! Yknow howbefore you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank Ithought it would be too, but its not. I mean its not at all.
Ross: (pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!
Ross: We had such a great time! Shes-shes incredible! I thoughtthe-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasnt. It wasnt at all.Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.)(To Monica) A concept lost on some people!
Ross: Well, not really. I mean technically its-its not against therules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into lastnight, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Ross: Yeah. What-what should I do?
Ross: Going out with who?
Ross: Oh yeah! Wasnt she uh (Does the international sign for bigboobies.)
Ross: What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Ross: Oh, you have some studying to do?
Ross: Yknow I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to(He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)
Ross: Nothing, Im-Im just, Im so comfortable with you!
Ross: What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Ross: What?! No! No! Wait! Youre right, this is stupid. Who cares whatpeople think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? Theres nothing wrong withthat. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.)Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Ross: Thats right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, weredating. And you may frown upon that, but were not gonna hide it anymore.
Ross: What?
Ross: Really? Its not just frowned upon?
Ross: Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I cant date you or have a hotplate in my office. I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Ross: I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Itsagainst the rules. Its forbidden.
Ross: What?
Ross: Really?
Ross: Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, itswrong.
Ross: (feeling it too) No! No! Its wrong! Its-its-itsnaughty. Its taboo.
Ross: Lets also get a hot plate!
Ross: Hey everybody!
Ross: Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
Ross: Oh no-no-no, were just two people who happen to run into each otherhere at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)
Ross: Bye.
Ross: Oh that is quite all right maam. (Elizabeth exits.)
Ross: Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Ross: Anyone else? Huh? Bring em on!
Ross: I dont know Rachel, why?
Ross: Well thanks!
Ross: Well, actually its been great. Shes 20 so shes notlooking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Ross: Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it reallymeans a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are
Ross: Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I dontknow.
Ross: Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Ross: Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why dont we goinside?
Ross: Oh-ooh!
Ross: Doorknob! Doorknob!
Ross: Oh, okay. What-what about?
Ross: Spring vacation.
Ross: (quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professorFeesen-sen-stenlger Ill be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I willtake one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)
Ross: You dont understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a tripwith her! Is that taking it slow?! No, Im not ready for this! Okay? What-what do Itell her?
Ross: I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Ross: What the hell are you doing?
Ross: What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Ross: Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells insideand recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while.
Ross: Do not give him any money!
Ross: Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
Ross: Oo-oo!
Ross: Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted tofinish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Ross: Look, I (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, Im havinga great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to muchpressure on us. So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet.Its-its too soon.
Ross: No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meantwas
Ross: That! Lets talk about that.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. Shedidnt want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that shes goingto Florida for spring vacation.
Ross: Whats-whats the difference?
Ross: Hey, yknow what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
Ross: I went to Egypt with my dad.
Ross: Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Springbreak!" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean shes taken my class!
Ross: Im gonna call her.
Ross: Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo.That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girls bodies,waking up next to people you dont even know
Ross: Okay, she cant go.
Ross: Then what am I supposed to do?
Ross: Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Ross: Im so glad youre going on this trip!
Ross: Sure. Sure. Look I dont, I dont know if your plans arefinalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
Ross: Are you into crafts at all?
Ross: Well, yeah, of-of course Im okay! What? Im just beingsupportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-whatis uh, whats this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)
Ross: To wear in front of people?
Ross: Is this?!
Ross: So uh, have a great time down there.
Ross: Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Ross: It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm,I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because its revealing which Imfine with, no Im concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Ross: Well, if whats in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes youget 30, sometimes its-its get 4, and I swear to God more often than notits just milk.
Ross: Really?
Ross: Okay. Cool.
Ross: Call me!
Ross:  Excuse me?
Joey:  I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, andthen- I'm his butt.Monica: (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.Joey:  C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, andthat's big!Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after allyour years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.Joey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!Ross: You're right, you're right, it is.
Ross:  So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Ross: Its your turn.
Ross: Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didntgo well but it really did go well?
Ross: Totally!
Ross: Great!
Ross: Wow!
Ross: Oh, I love that guy! (Laughs.)
Ross: (stops laughing) What am I doing?
Ross: Look, dont worry. Okay? Youre gonna be fine.
Ross: Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Ross:  Oh my God!
Ross: You ate my sandwich?
Ross: (getting upset) Oh-oh really? 
Ross: (jumping to his feet in anger) What?
Ross: You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
Ross:  (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
Ross: MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
Ross: What?
Ross: What?
Ross: Yes, yes it is. In prison!
Ross: It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Ross: I didnt know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! Ididnt finish the whole letter!
Ross: I fell asleep!
Ross: It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front andback!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen)(to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means you are,Y-O-U-R means your!
Ross: (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behindit)
Ross: Thatll be a neat trick, when youre, (looks at the script) whenyoure dead!
Ross: There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired. 
Ross: Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac
Ross: Oh my God. I mean
Ross: Totally.

Ross: Eh-whExcuse me?
Ross: Thats funny. Umm. (Pause, then serious) Its not funny.
Ross: Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, onechance I can, I can change your mind.
Ross: What?
Ross: This isyou(Ross starts laughing.)

I mean, I mean Ive been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have neverdone it with a studentI mean I notnot it! I mean, I mean IdontWe havent done it.

Ross: Thats okay Rach, were not liking Ross right now.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Why? What?
Ross: No, no, thats funny. But maybe its time to move on, let it go,yknow? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeths father, so ah,hes much older than she is. Looks like Im not the only one interested infossils, huh?
Ross: Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings(Paul enters) in his ear.

Ross: Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us offbefore?
Ross: Phoebe, whyd you do it?
Ross: What?! Why?!
Ross: I cant think of anything.
Ross: Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didnt invite him to thatKnicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Ross: I guess it could.
Ross: Well, if hes angry, he really shouldnt just cover it up. I-Iwish he would just tell me the truth.
Ross: Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Ross: Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Ross: Okay. Well, apparently Chandlers angry at us for not getting him aticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Ross: Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up,yknow? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game andinvite him.
Ross: Oh. (Starts to get his money) 
Ross: All the time?
Ross: Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
Ross: What?!
Ross: I cant believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? Im alittle mad at him now.
Ross: Yknow what? He didnt want to talk to us about being angry,well maybe we dont talk to him at all!
Ross: Thats right!
Ross: Eh? Well show him!
Ross: Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Ross: So you two are really serious?!
Ross: You-youre gonna get married?! I mean Were gonna bebrothers-in-law! (They hug.)

Ross: Uh-uhWow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I hadno idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological agedifference but I never notice it.

Ross: Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Ross: (to the rest of them) Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!

Ross: Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Ross: Yknow, maybe she is too young for me. Yknow, when I was overthere and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. Ifinally started to see what you guys were talking about. I dont know what to do.
Ross: Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, Im-Im 12 years older than she is.

Ross: Look lets not make a big deal out of this! It was a one timething. It doesnt even matter!
Ross: Oh no!
Ross: And; people thinking its huge has led Monica to believe that weare stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!
Ross: Guess who? (Enters fully.)
Ross: Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air
Ross: Still thinking about it huh?
Ross: (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?
Ross: (tightening his tie) And so do I.
Ross: Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)
Ross: (sitting up) No! (Exits.)
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey, heres a thought.
Ross: Got me. (He shows of his hands.)
Ross: Uh, Rachel, Ive been thinking. I dont think us gettingtogether tonight is such a good idea. Im calling it off.

Ross: Oww!
Ross: (deadpan) Well, Im going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulationsman.
Ross: (at the door) And uh, Rachel.

Ross: Hi!
Ross: Oh, Ill have some!
Ross: Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to saythe right name.
Ross: Oh my God, the wedding book?! I havent seen that since the forthgrade!
Ross: And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for JurassicPark first! Now lets take a look at (Phoebe rushes in.)
Ross: Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?

Ross: Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Ross: Uh, Phoebe
Ross: Phoebe, what are you doing?
Ross: Phoebe!
Ross: Phoebe, you cant massage people in my apartment!
Ross: And they knew about it?
Ross: Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever Iwant!
Ross: The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartmentwhen I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer.
Ross: Hello.
Ross: Uh no-no, she-shes out for the night.
Ross: Can I, can I help you with something?
Ross: (deadpan) Yes I am.
Ross: Okay! Now, Im going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh,thats soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massagehim with those.)
Ross: (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Ross: (takes a drink) Damn, this coffees cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if Iheat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)
Ross: So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?

Ross: (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) Im sorry?
Ross: (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Ross: Okay, so it wasnt uh, a traditional massage. But I did give himaccu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with amop.
Ross: Hey, yknow what? This is your fault! Youre the one thatdidnt move his-his appointment.
Ross: He said he liked that!! Oh youre right, youre right. Imsorry.
Ross: His daughter was hot.
Ross: About what?
Ross: Well, you-youve always had glasses.
Ross: Are you sure?
Ross: (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Ross: No, why?
Ross: My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Ross: Yeah and he didnt really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumedhe meant you.
Ross: No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Ross: Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals thetrash cans. He does that every week too.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Youre not a lefty? 
Ross: Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Ross: No one got me an engagement present.
Ross: Two! Ive been engaged twice!
Ross: (entering with Chandler) Hey.
Ross: Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand
Ross: And what did he ask you not to call him?
Ross: Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
Ross: Cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.
Ross: Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have tobond to that part?
Ross: Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape fromfat camp.
Ross: Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Ross: You were trying to eat it!
Ross: Whoa-whoa, arent you a little over dressed?
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Ross: Thank you!
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Yeeeeeep Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on herdads boat she wouldnt let me help at all.
Ross: You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)
Ross: Lets give it a shot.
Ross: Ohh, these are pretty good.
Ross: Which one was that?
Ross: Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps alittle bit.) Im okay.
Ross: Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh (Grabs acookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesnt like it.) Its batch 16! 16people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)
Ross: Looking up?
Ross: Aww, Pheeb, come on isnt there any relative that would have therecipe? What about, what about your sister?
Ross: Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive gotshuffleboard that day.
Ross: Ohhhh
Ross: It wasnt the best.
Ross: Well, the lighting was okay.
Ross: Oh great! That means Im stuck with, "So, we were watching youin there (Points to the TV) and you were sittin right here! Whoa!"
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Oh, nothin much. Just trying to figure out what Im gonna dofor dinner.
Ross: (notices the table) HeyOoh! Whats-whats that, dinnerstuff? You making dinner?
Ross: What you got over there? Tacos?
Ross: Uhh, those are tacos.
Ross: Eh, either way Ill pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still canteat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.)Whats so funny?!
Ross: (To Chandler) You told her!
Ross: (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! Its not like Ichoose to do it! Its not likeIts not like I said, "Umm, what wouldmake this ride more fun?!"
Ross: (To Chandler) How could you tell her?!
Ross: Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Ross: Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
Ross: And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goesover to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know whatyoure thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makesout with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goesto bars and makes out withgirls.
Ross: Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
Ross: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Ross: All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contestand won!
Ross: Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandlershould know some of your secrets too!
Ross: Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaronioff a jewelry box shed made.
Ross: Monica couldnt tell time til she was 13!
Ross: Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady whocleaned our dorm!
Ross: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Ross: And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Ross: And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret fromeverybody else.
Ross: Okay, (gets up) if youll excuse me, I-Im gonna go hang outwith some people who dont know the Space Mountain story.
Ross: Man! (Monica mouths, "Im sorry.")
Ross: (To Chandler) Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh
Ross: Amazing!
Ross: Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While HePees.
Ross: Its not a club.
Ross: Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
Ross: Soon hell be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Ross: Maybe I should open a divorced mens club.
Ross: I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Ross: I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say, "I love you andthats why I have to kill you."
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: What?! No!
Ross: Look, I dont think so Pheebs. (Pause) All right, Ill do it.But just because youre a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)
Ross: All right! I want my key back!
Ross: Its right there! (Points to her hand.)
Ross: Look, Im sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Ross: Oh yeahNoYoure welcome. Well talk about it later.
Ross: Hi Whitney.
Ross: Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.
Ross: (opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! Im sorry, but can you give me asecond while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Ross: Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we endedup having a great time! Okay?
Ross: Yes! Thats where we realized we were both super cool people!
Ross: Like what?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast Ill be on full alertfor room painting and sex weapons.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course herex-husbands gonna say that stuff. Now, if youll excuse me
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okayand F.Y.Ishe mustve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And hisresponse to each one was, "I dont give a tiny rats ass."
Ross: Well, I dont think we are gonna have that problem, but maybethats just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Ross: I think he can be.
Ross: Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Ross: (angrily) I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! Thatwas three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Ross: So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.)Im sorry you had to see that.
Ross: My God!
Ross: Well maybe she wouldnt have to be selfish in bed if someone elseknew where everything was!
Ross: Wh-whats up?
Ross: Oh just say it Kyle!
Ross: (To Whitney) Yknow, he hums when he pees!
Ross: It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Ross: Thats all right, we-we dont need you. In fact, hey Imover it already.
Ross: (To Phoebe) Im sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right abouther. Yknow, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back alittle.
Ross: Yeah, were better off without them.
Ross: Divorced mens club.
Ross: Joey, we just saw it!
Ross: And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Joey and Ross: Die Hard!!!!!!
Ross: Dude, you didnt say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Ross: Well, John McLane had plans!
Ross: What happened?!!
Ross: We fell asleep! That is all.
Ross: I think that would be best.
Ross: Okay. But not about this!
Ross: No touch! No touch!
Ross: Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. 
Ross: Just uh, brought back your videos.
Ross: No! No we dont!
Ross: I I dont know what you are talking about.
Ross: Ive had better.
Ross: All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Ross: Ive said it! Okay?! But its over Joey!
Ross: We cant do it again.
Ross: Because its weird!
Ross: Sure, what do you got?
Ross: No, 10 is the highest.
Ross: Because its the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachelyoure up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: Youre withMonica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing thepart of Monica.)
Ross: Yes, very nice Rachel.
Ross: (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I rememberthat(Phoebe screams and tackles him)Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Ross: It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Ross: Go!
Ross: Yeah, it really was!
Ross: Okay Phoebe, I guess youre next (To Joey) although I reallydont see the point.
Ross: Im sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Ross: Actually, it wasnt that close.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Why-why would I care about that?
Ross: It really was.
Ross: (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)
Ross: Okay, okay take a guess.
Ross: Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier,yknow-yknow for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoraldissertation! Its here! Yeah, its right-its right down here! In thebiggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secludedsection behind the racks.)
Ross: (stopping quickly) Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman namedWendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the nextaisle.) What is that?
Ross: People are doing it in front of my book!
Ross: My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,and there were students makin babies right in the middle of the Paleontologysection!
Ross: Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place oncampus where students went to uh, fool around.
Ross: Great! Because people kept showing up, I think its like uh-a thing!
Ross: Oh for cryin out loud! (He storms out.)
Ross: Excuse me. Hi, Im a professor here. Do you know the Paleontologysection, fifth floor, stack 437?
Ross: No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarianbrings his boss over.)
Ross: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in thePaleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it peopleare-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
Ross: Well, fine. Fine! If-if Im the only person with any appreciation ofthe sanctity of the written word, Ill go up there and defend it myself! (Starts todo so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And dont you follow me!
Ross: Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Ross: Oh-oh, youre-youre fellow scholars. What exactly were youlooking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. ChesterStocks musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Ross: Ah AhGet out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross startslooking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into thesection.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marions viewson evolution?
Ross: I find Marions views far to progressionist.
Ross: Im a professor here uh, RossGeller.
Ross: Yes! Youre the person who checked out my book?!
Ross: Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
Ross: I am veryvery sorry.
Ross: (to the guard) Dont sweat it, Ive got this section covered.Yeah, in fact Ive got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine inpeoples eye(The guard walks away)Okay, see you later. 
Ross: (entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! 
Ross: What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? 
Ross: What? That's like insanely easy! 
Ross: What? You forgot fourteen states? 
Ross: Wow, how many have you got? 
Ross: Done! With time a-to-spare. 
Ross: You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that agroup of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map,or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm? 
Ross: What? That's impossible. 
Ross: No, just give me another minute. 
Ross: This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50before dinner. 
Ross: You're on! 
Ross: Pshhshhh!
Ross: Phoebe, why is your bag moving? 
Ross: Ohio!! Thank you! 
Ross: What dog? There-there's no dog here. 
Ross: Are you out of your mind?
Ross: Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treatout of my hand!!!
Ross: It's too cold. 
Ross: (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.
Ross: How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
Ross: Damn, I forgot you were here. 
Ross: Hey! What's she doing back here? 
Ross: Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically... 
Ross: Yeah, but, but look what I'm... 
Ross: Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. 
Ross: Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. 
Ross: No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now. 
Ross: Because you sent away the dog!
Ross: Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dognamed Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and herfriendPhyllistake away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him.Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed. 
Ross: From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying)Yes, please! 
Ross: I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving. 
Ross: Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tellyou something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be ableto eat something. 
Ross: Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't getthe chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? 
Ross: Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.) 
Ross: Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!
Ross: (hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now! 
Ross: (pauses) I know. 
Ross: You sure?
Ross: No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, its all yours.(Ross pushes him off.)
Ross: Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (shocked) What?!
Ross: Ohh.
Ross: That is so unfair!
Ross: Mine stole my newspaper! Its like a crime wave!! (Monica runsto make more candy.) Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Ross: Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-Icouldnt stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike,so 
Ross: You like it?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Ahh.
Ross: Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, yknow give ita test ride.
Ross: (stunned at the complement) Youre welcome.
Ross: Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Ross: Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Ross: Pheebs you uhyou do know how to ride a bike dont you?
Ross: Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and youll be fine.Okay? Here we go. ReadySet
Ross: Phoebe, you cant get out of this! Okay? You have to learn howto ride a bike!
Ross: WellIn-in case of emergency.
Ross: Well let therewhat if a man comes along and puts a gun to your headand says, "You ride this bike or Ill shIll shoot you."
Ross: Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike andHey! Ill holdyou up and-and push you. Okay?
Ross: No!
Ross: I swear!
Ross: Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (Theystart.) 
Ross: All right. Feel good?
Ross: All right, try pedaling. 
Ross: Thats it, your doing great.
Ross: Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Ross: Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at himand falls off the bike.)
Ross: I-I just thought you were doing so well. I
Ross: Its a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing thewoman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!
Ross: Hey, theres uh, some people outside, askin about candy.
Ross: Need some help?
Ross: By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (Sheglares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebes room.)
Ross: (entering) Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike.
Ross: I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were soclose Phoebe!
Ross: Phoebe.
Ross: All right, yknow what? If you are not going to learn how to ridethis bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back.
Ross: Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having thisguitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to beplayed! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you dont ride ityou-youre-youre killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying.
Ross: Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) Youre making the bike veryhappy.
Ross: Oh hey, dont thank me, thank yourself. Youre the one who facedher fears and ultimately overcame them.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: (Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben forthe holidays this year.
Ross: Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take thisyear to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Ross: Hmm.
Ross: Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, doya?
Ross: Well, I do, so let's... (Ben and Ross sit down on the couch) So, Ben, youuh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
Ross: Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Ross: Yes, but also (Pauses to let Ben answer, but he doesnt.) Hanukkah!See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Ross: Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See,years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Ross: (interrupts him) Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh(Sings) Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Ross: (interrupts him again) Okay, it's not a contest.
Ross: Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebratingHanukkah?
Ross: No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Ross: No, hey-hey, come on, (He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap) Ben, Santa isnot mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Ross: (disappointed) Yes! Santa's coming!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: No, these are my pants.
Ross: Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Ross: Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and Ireally don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, Iuh, you gotta have something.
Ross: I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here towish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!
Ross: (to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Ross: That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states.And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to benddown to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe theLady will help me with these presents.
Ross: You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Ross: (gasps) You are? Me, too!
Ross: (to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what ifthe Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Ross: What are you doing here, Santa?
Ross: I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here togive Ben some presents. Remember?
Ross: (to Chandler) What are you doing?
Ross: Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Ross: Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, andyou're-youre wrecking it.
Ross: I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Ross: Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Ross: Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Ross: All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, therewere these people called the Maccabees.
Ross: and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldvejust lasted just one day, burned for
Ross: Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. Theend.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! OkayBen, its time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben,and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
Ross: Come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles!
Ross: Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Ross: Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow,do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Ross: Cousin Frannies wedding, its tomorrow night.
Ross: No.
Ross: Well l-look okay, its probably just a mistake. Let me call AuntSheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Ross: Yknow, she tried to undress me too.
Ross: Hey, yknow what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monicashakes her head in disgust.)
Ross: Phoebe hes right, that is the rule.
Ross: Hey Joe, while youre over there how about another beer for theRoss-A-Tron?
Ross: (entering) Hey.
Ross: So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasnta mistake. Ahh, theres-theres limited seating in the hall.
Ross: Well yeah, but she doesnt know that. I mean, the last time she sawyou-you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. 
Ross: Oh whats the big deal?! I wasnt even invited to the ceremony,just the reception. And-and yknow what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and Iwill just make an appearance and then, and then well-well leave early as asign of protest.
Ross: Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. Shes an assistant professor in theLinguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, notbroad backed!
Ross: (interrupting) Not broad backed!
Ross: What? I cant cancel on Joan!
Ross: BecDid you not hear me?! Shes an assistant professor in theLinguistics department, okay? Theyre wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Ross: Okay, all right, Ill take you. Ill go call Joan. (Does so.)
Ross: Oh here, I think this is us. (Reading the name cards.) Yeah.
Ross: (To Monica) Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
Ross: Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Ross: Yes, yes it is. Its uh (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity tograb Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with anapkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Ross: Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here soyou can ambush her.
Ross: That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps onFrannies shoulder.)
Ross: (to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Ross: So its really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Ross: What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there AuntMillie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets herattention.)
Ross: Well
Ross: Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monicas wrap andwalks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)
Ross: Well, technically it seven billion years ago (Well,technically youd be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could seeit with all of the bright lights of New York.)
Ross: Okay! Okay! Fine, Ill stop! No teaching, okay? Well just watchthe pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets dont streak across the sky,meteors do.) Okay? Whos official name is Bapstein-King.
Ross: Man, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them fromthe city?) Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesnt it?
Ross: Huh?
Ross: What?
Ross: What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joeys standing.)
Ross: Joey comeI cant believeI bring you here to see theBapstein-King comet, one of natures most spectacular phenomenon, and all you careabout are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Ross: Show me where?
Ross: (noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey wheres the pipethat was holding the door open?
Ross: Joey!
Ross: Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? (Joey starts to groan.)Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer! 
Ross: Rachel!! Monica!!
Ross: I cant believe this!!
Ross: (standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we dont have achoice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! Were stuck up on the roofand we cant get down!!!
Ross: (To Joey) I know, I wasnt finished. (Joey motions him to finish.)(Yelling at the street) But dont worry! Were gonna go down the fire escape!!
Ross: Ugh. Well, were just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah.Now, were gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay?Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownishred stuff in the middle. So, when you get down thereyou go up to theroof and you let me in.
Ross: Yeah! Oh yeah, youll be fine! It-itll be uh, just like bungyjumping. Yknow? But instead of bouncing back up you-you wont.
Ross: Well, Im gonna lie to you Joey, its a possibility.
Ross: Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of thelanding above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?
Ross: Okay. Well, you be careful.
Ross: Well Im jumping! I have a son! Okay? He wont have a fatherif-if I die!
Ross: (looking in the window behind them) Yknow, yknow Imlookin and I dont think anyones home here. I say we just break thewindow, crawl through, and-and yknow explain later.
Ross: I dont think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big,large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of thelanding.) When you get in there (Joey nods his disapproval.)
Ross: Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Ross: Okay, Im going to start climb down you now.
Ross: Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so were face toface or-or should I climb down your back so were-were butt to face.
Ross: I would say that.
Ross: Okay, here I go.
Ross: I prefer not to answer that right now, Im still carrying a littleholiday weight.

Ross: and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that theVelociraptor would expand its collar and emit a high pitched noise to frightenits predator. (A student raises his hand.) Yes Mr. Lewis? 
Ross: Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
Ross: Well we-we dont know for sure. But in my head it-it soundedsomething like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesnt know what tomake of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, thats uh, thats all fortoday. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?

Ross: Theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me.
Ross: I do-I do not have a boyfriend. Theres a guy in one of myclasses who-who has a crush on me.
Ross: Yeah! I dont know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind ofsexy professor vibe? (Racheland Joey both look at him.)
Ross: It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Ross: Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.

Ross: And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)
Ross: (turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!
Ross: No!

Ross: Well Im, Im a little slow. (To himself) Just as our childrenwould be.

She was the one whosuggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. Shewas the one that wanted to rent Logans Run, the sexiest movie ever. (Shegrabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) Oh, I know that look. Forget it. Iwant it. She wants it. Im going in. 
Ross: (in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay, doesnthave to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words willdo. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause)There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (Toher) I-I, I uh havent had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In hishead) Yeah, you really shouldnt have said anything.
Ross: She seems really, really fun!

Ross: I cant believe in four weeks theyre gonna be married!
Ross: Phoebe thats not true.
Ross: Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Ross: (entering) What's going on?
Ross: What?! What?!
Ross: Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebestarts jumping to divert his attention.)

Ross: We are never gonna find him! Hes one guy in a huge city!
Ross: That is an old, Chinese woman!
Ross: Aw, yknowYknow, maybe were-were justapproaching this all wrong. If youre Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is thelast place on Earth people would think youd go?

Ross: Then you are neither of your parents!
Ross: Yknow, okay. Youre right. It is huge. So why dont wetake it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; justforget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Ross: (interrupting him) YeahNo-but-but-but-but! Were just gonna gohome and take a shower. Now, thats not scary right?
Ross: There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasnt so scary, was it?

Ross: Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)
Ross: Im trying. (He strains to move his feet.)
Ross: Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gerts shocked and Ross realizeswhat he said and tries to brush it off.)

Ross: No-no-no, Im saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) atthe gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is makesure not to get anybody elses faces.
Ross: Im just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do youreally want to start your life together by letting her down?

Ross: Oh well, I guess Ill catch up with her later.
Ross: Oh no.
Ross: I think I might know what this is about.
Ross: Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we werent gonna tell anybody this but uh,about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
Ross: Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
Ross: Well, we-we said wed just do it that one time but, but now I thinkshe may wanna start things up again.
Ross: Why? What-what else could it be?
Ross: Im telling you. Im telling you. Thats what it is. Nowonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didnt say anything toyou?
Ross: Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, yknow what I have torealize? Maybe Im just not the type of guy women can have just one night with.Yknow, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (Hepauses and then exits.)
Ross: Hi.
Ross: (quietly confident) I think we do. Why dont we go inside? (They goinside.) Look uh, I know why youre here.
Ross: Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I shouldtalk first.
Ross: Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross.Thats been one heck of a see-saw hasnt it?
Ross: I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun andand certainlypassionate, but dont you think its better if we just stayed friends?
Ross: Okay. Okay. Yknow what? If you want to, we can do it one more time.I mean Id-Id be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
Ross: Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)
Ross: Im good. Im good.
Ross: Yeah, I need uh Im justI dont knowIdont understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
Ross: What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
Ross: No they dont!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns withhis box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
Ross: Oh well I may as well have!
Ross: Freaked out? Hey no, Im not freaked out! Im indignant!As a consumer!
Ross: No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? IIn fact, (picks up the phone) Iam going to talk to the president of the condom company!
Ross: (grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!
Ross: (on phone) Yeah Ill press 1! (Presses one which allows Rachel toescape.)
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Sure.
Ross: Namaste. (Bows.)
Ross: Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
Ross: Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
Ross: Yeah but uh Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slepttogether, but theres something else. (Pause) Rachels pregnant.
Ross: With my child.
Ross: You already know dont you?
Ross: Okay. Okay. I mean Ill be okay. Its just I dont think Ihandled it very well.
Ross: Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.And then when I turned around she was gone.
Ross: But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97%effective.
Ross: I gotta go find her.
Ross: Evidently they do.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Uh we-we need to talk.
Ross: Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
Ross: What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) Im sorry. I mean I-Ithink I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towardsRachels feet) reallyI should have been thinking about you Rach
Ross: Right! Right! I justI want you to know that Im going to bethere through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctors appointments, the uh, theLamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartmentAlthough we could probably worry aboutthat til after we get married.
Ross: Well yeah, I think we should get married.
Ross: No, because thats the right thing to do.
Ross: No butbut still you cant possibly do this alone.
Ross: Come on Rach, you cant even eat alone in a restaurant.
Ross: Im just saying if you cant eat by yourself, how do you expectto have a baby by yourself?
Ross: When have you ever?
Ross: Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Ross: I grew up with Monica! If you didnt eat fast you didnt eat!!
Ross: But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
Ross: (To Rachel, standing by her feet) I dont know why you cantadmit that you need me.
Ross: Oh my God.
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: Pretty amazing huh?
Ross: What? What?!
Ross: You-you just said that you did!
Ross: Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,(rolls the machine closer) its-its-its, its right there (Points).
Ross: Do you really?
Ross: Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? (Points) This tiny thingthat looks like a peanut?
Ross: Sweetie thats it.
Ross: Youre welcome.
Ross: Yeah, thats our baby.
Ross: Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Ross: Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
Ross: Hello!
Ross: So, how was the honeymoon?
Ross: (glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)
Ross: (laughs) Umm thatsthats a little misleading.
Ross: The lie you just told.
Ross: Theres the one!
Ross: Yes lets. Yknow what? Uh, its-its not important.What is important is that, is that were having a baby. And itsnotDoesnt matter who came on to who.
Ross: What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending mesignals all over the place!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Yknow what?! It doesnt matter! It doesnt matter what youbelieve! What matters is what happened!
Ross: Yknow what? Yknow what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
Ross: I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) Its anexpression.
Ross: (entering) Rachel wont talk to me! She wont even open thedoor!
Ross: Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
Ross: Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, heres whathappened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and ahalf ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing. 
Ross: Aboutabout sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadnt hadsex in months?
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Do you have a minute? Id like to talk to you about somethingIm, Im really uncomfortable talking about.
Ross: I actually had a topic in mind! Im, Im kinda going through adry spell, sex wise.
Ross: Five to be lying, six.
Ross: Well, I mean its not all bad. Im learning to appreciate theuh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
Ross: Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go wellokayIm scared for my health!
Ross: Really? Well then tell it to me.
Ross: (sarcastic) Ill try to control myself.
Ross: (laughs) You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Ross: (stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. Im sorry. Please, please, you werein Western Europe and?
Ross: (intently listening) Why?
Ross: Its from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe. Yknow umm,a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Ross: Uh-hmmWait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
Ross: Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking
Ross: (whines) Oh thats great! I was hiking along the foothills of MountTibidaybo
Ross: Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Ross: Great! Im across the street having sex with her right now. Yourstory sucks!
Ross: No! No, I dontdont want to.
Ross: I was backpacking across Western Europe.
Ross: I was just outside Barcelona, hiking
Ross: Its been six months! Im always hot!
Ross: Ill try that.
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Ross: Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know Illhelp you out.
Ross: Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?(Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Thats less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
Ross: (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot aboutthe camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.
Ross: What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Ross: Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, "Youll show me right?")No!
Ross: Joey! No!
Ross: Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, Ididnt even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) Ithought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)
Ross: Forget it, shes destroying it.
Ross: Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? Its Rachels tape and she can dowhatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
Ross: What?!
Ross: I dont want people to see it for your sake.
Ross: Rachel, please
Ross: Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the highroad, because in about five minutes Im gonna be saying(He laughs and points atRachel sarcastically.)
Ross: (on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?
Ross: (on tape) You didnt do it?
Ross: (pause) Not on the ones we sent out.
Ross: (on tape) I know. Hey rememberremember the night they got engaged?How uh, you and I almost
Ross: (on tape) I mean II know I wanted to. I just, I just wasntsure if you wanted to.
Ross: (on tape) So wewe both wanted to.
Ross: (on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
Ross: And in about five seconds youre gonna see why.
Ross: Now Im so happy.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing reallydoesnt matter. I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way. I mean if youhadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve.
Ross: It was. It was an amazing night.
Ross: I uh I dont know. I mean II honestly didnt watchit.
Ross: Uhhhhhhthat-that may be weird.

Ross: Im telling you, I like the food!
Ross: Did that guy just call you Toby?
Ross: Well, why dont you correct him?
Ross: Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
Ross: (laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizessomething.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? Its not just an M, your middle nameis Muriel!!
Ross: Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
Ross: (entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!
Ross: So, what do you want to do tonight? Theres a Ukrainian film at theAngelica thats supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
Ross: Rach? You wanna come?
Ross: A date?
Ross: Why no, its the opposite of weird. Its-its uh, regular.Its-its uh, its mundane. Its actually uh, a little dull.
Ross: A date?! Shes-shes got a date?! With who?
Ross: You set her up?!
Ross: Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Ross: Joey, Im not worried about her! Im worried about my baby!Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actortaking them?

Ross: Hi. I-I hear youre going on a ferry tonight.
Ross: A bit of a daredevil are we?
Ross: Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Ross: Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear theentire sentence.)
Ross: Books?
Ross: Well, I tell you what. Why dont we uh, why dont we just stayhere? Lets not see a movie, well just hang.
Ross: Hey, if thats what you want to do Im not gonna say no.
Ross: I justI have to find out how it went.
Ross: This guy could be my babys stepfather!
Ross: I justI-I cant believe shes-shes dating?!
Ross: I dont know! I guess I just cant believe any of this ishappening.
Ross: Its just I always thought when I had another kid it would bedifferent. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol andSusans, its likeIt breaks my heart a little. I mean Ive always hadthis picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in andleaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Yknow? Maybe fight overthe science section.
Ross: No! No I cant. I mean Rachels out with some guy. My baby wentwith her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Ross: It used to be. Now she doesnt really have a face. Smokin bodythough.
Ross: No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
Ross: No, its not what I want either. I mean I-I cant force myselfto fall in love with her again now.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Ross: Hello.

Ross: You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
Ross: Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
Ross: Right. Good night.

Ross: Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well,Im a potato or aspud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander withan old TV antenna glued on top that hes wearing.) So Sputnik, becomes(Theyre still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!

Ross: I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and Im so sorry for yourloss.
Ross: What?
Ross: Oh, thank God!
Ross: Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokesher head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)
Ross: Yknow I would its just painful.
Ross: Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translatesthat phrase into Dutch.)
Ross: Yeah, were done.
Ross: Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)
Ross: Really?!
Ross: Sweet!
Ross: Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
Ross: No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Ross: Its not for me, its for Rachel.
Ross: Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.
Ross: Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
Ross: (finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther!Youre an ezel!
Ross: Damnit!
Ross: Hi. How is she?
Ross: (happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her somebloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)
Ross: Oh I dont know that it would.
Ross: All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)
Ross: Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for onelast kiss. But I dont care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!
Ross: (stutters looking for words) Ezels!!
Ross: Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there alittle.
Ross: Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
Ross: Okay, I-Ill see you tonight.
Ross: Okay, bye. 
Ross: Ah, its good. Its going good. I mean, we get along great.Shes, shes so
Ross: Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
Ross: Well II havent actually told her yet. I dont want toscare her off, yknow?
Ross: Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods hisagreement.)
Ross: Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona againtonight.
Ross: Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Ross: So much more.
Ross: Aw forget it, its from Pier One. (Theres an angry knockon the door.) Sorry. (Goes and opens the door to an irate Dr. Green.)
Ross: Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
Ross: Who did?!
Ross: Yes. Yes, yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was, it was just a one nightthing. It meant nothing.
Ross: No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I careI-I loveRachel.
Ross: (to Mona) Oh but not that way. I meanI mean Im not in lovewith her. I love her like a, like a friend.
Ross: (to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!
Ross: (To Mona) But I didnt want to.
Ross: Im sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
Ross: I was going to tell you, but
Ross: Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (Thephone rings and Ross goes to answer it, only hes trapped behind the apothecary tableby Dr. Green.) Can I just (Dr. Green glares at him.) Why dont we just let themachine get that?
Ross: No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down.
Ross: So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man!
Ross: I dont care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and nowshes totally freaked out!
Ross: Rachel!
Ross: Okay!
Ross: Thank you!
Ross: Thank you so much for coming back over.
Ross: Focus.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Trying to date this woman.
Ross: Probably shouldnt touch me.
Ross: Should I leave this open for you too?
Ross: Because whats going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feelabout you.
Ross: I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard itfrom Rachels father. Look II made a mistake, but its only because Ireally, really like you. Really!
Ross: (entering) Will!
Ross: Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Rossrealizes what he said.) Hot stuff?
Ross: Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
Ross: Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
Ross: Oh! Man I dont think Ive seen you since uh, Lance Davisgraduation party.
Ross: Yeah. It wouldve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (laughs) Yeah.
Ross: So how long are you in town?
Ross: Awoh, thats right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
Ross: Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
Will: Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross:Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.
Ross: No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
Ross: No. No.
Ross: Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand butI-I dont think he-he knew what it was.
Ross: That was in high school! Its not like it was binding forever.
Ross: Look Rach I-Im sorry, okay? II was a stupid kid, okay? Theonly reason I joined
Ross: co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in lovewith you. Obviously I didnt handle it very well. But if you think about it the IHate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Ross: No-no! No-no. No-no.
Ross: It was no big deal. We-wesaid that the rumor wasthatummyou had bothmale and female reproductive parts.
Ross: Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that ones not really ourfault.
Ross: Rach, I think youre reading a little too much into it.
Ross: Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in theentire school and tell them it wasnt true?!
Ross: Well look-look Im not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a millionyears ago!
Ross: What?
Ross: (shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!
Ross: No.
Ross: Hey! She didnt look 50!
Ross: She didnt photograph well!
Ross: I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two ofus. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you mustknow, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace
Ross: Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I cant believe you-you toldpeople about this?! Everybody knew?! Yknow what? (To Will) Im back in theclub!
Ross: As a romancer of the elderly.
Ross: The eyesdid still sparkle.
Ross: Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Nope.
Ross: Thats right, I love you! And-and Im gonna play with you allthe time.
Ross: Bye.
Ross: Yeah. Why?
Ross: Yeah I know; hes in Bens class.
Ross: Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about tosit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)
Ross: What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
Ross: Uh, I actually havent even met him.
Ross: Well actually, Im picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe hell bethere.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school
Ross: I dropped him off at Carols. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it turns out thatIm not going to be able to get those tickets though.
Ross: Well it turns out that Ben and Stings son do not get along.
Ross: Apparently, Stings son made fun of the fact that Bens moms arelesbinims.
Ross: Phoebe, you cant force kids to be friends.
Ross: Playpen?! Bens seven!
Ross: Look Im sorry Pheebs, I cant do it.
Ross: What?
Ross: Look Phoebe, Im sorry its just
Ross: Phoebe, I
Ross: Youre gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)
Ross: Welllets just say (singing) Rosss caaaaan!
Ross: Uh, middle balcony.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Monaice skating?
Ross: Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of ustogether?
Ross: Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday cardyknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Ross: (pause) Together? Like-like to people?
Ross: Okay. (Not happy about it.)
Ross: Uh sure, sure.
Ross: I know. Can you believe that?
Ross: Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who havebeen dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Huh. Wow, this is great.
Ross: Well, we-we havent said that to each other yet, but I guess its okayto say it to other people.
Ross: A hundred?! Well, I-I guess Ill take aMona, uhI-Imnot sure about the whole uh, card thing.
Ross: Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just dont know ifwere really quite there yet.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Huh.
Ross: Hmm
Ross: Lets do the card!
Ross: The card! I think were there!
Ross: Really?! I mean, even with the card?
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Oh yeah, yeah were moving forward. Youll be getting our card!
Ross: Yeah, were not just doing a card! Yknow, she-she also wants tohave the conversation about where the relationship is going.
Ross: I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? Imean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
Ross: Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? Im not a mind reader! Besides, Ihate those conversations. Im horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of agesture. Yknow, something that says were moving forward without having to talkabout it.
Ross: Smaller than that.
Ross: Uh, bigger than that.
Ross: Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
Ross: Yeah I-I dont-I dont think Im quite there yet, but Icould say I looove spending time with you.
Ross: Forget it. I-IYknow what? Ill just have theconversation. Ill just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.What do you think Rach?
Ross: Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversationabout-about where things are with us.
Ross: Aw, we-we are so(Motions that theyre connected.) So umm, wellI-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you. And I mean-Imhaving a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides thereisnt.)
Ross: I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-ifits just fun. Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right? Sowhere-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! Thats-thats the real question. And-andthe answer isis its going somewherefun. Now I-I know what yourethinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-yourenot getting any younger. No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou aregetting younger. I meanyou-you look like youre getting younger by thesecondWhats your secret?
Ross: Well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young.
Ross: But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to myapartment. (Hands her his key.)
Ross: Really.
Ross: Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in avery serious relationship.
Ross: Oh great, I live on the street.
Ross: Okay, and oh Im gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I givethem away for no reason at all.
Ross: No. That guy is.
Ross: Im trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
Ross: I love you!
Ross: Hey! Oh, Im so glad you guys are here. Ive been dying to tellsomeone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
Ross: Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so.
Ross: No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why didnt Iget head of the department? (Goes and gets some coffee.)
Ross: which brings us back, of course, to Greelys theory of dominance.(The bell rings.) Okay, that-thats all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where theFreeman building is?
Ross: What?! That-thats all the way cross town, Im supposed to teacha graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
Ross: Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! Im the teacher!!
Ross: Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) Imsorry Im a little late. Ah(Checks his watch)Whoa! A lot late. Let mestart by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up,Im Professor Geller. Good job today.
Ross: No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding thephrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"
Ross: Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streetsitll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I?Rockefeller?
Ross: Well I have to. Okay? If I dont, theyll take the class awayfrom me. AndI already put it in my family newsletter.
Ross: Youve seen it, the Geller Yeller.
Ross: Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, Im sure I canmake it this time. I justI just cant be afraid to get a little bithit bycars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)
Ross: Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! Im on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from astudent, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay,why dont we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where (Exhalesagain) Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots. Okay, (Closes hisbook.) umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I(Passes outand collapses.)
Ross: Phoebe!!
Ross: So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now,the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and wesee why he made it to class on time, hes wearing in-line skates and hasnttaken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on theskates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs 
Ross: Right.
Ross: No-no, we talked about it. We dont want to know. All we care about isthat its happy and healthy.
Ross: And smart!
Ross: With an aptitude for science.
Ross: Really? Me too!
Ross: Maybe. But it wouldnt hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach,what were you thinking? (Gives her a look)
Ross: Huh. Thats a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
Ross: Well, OK, its for a boy. Well, I know its a little out there,butDarwin.
Ross: Youre just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
Ross: All right.
Ross: That sounds fair.
Ross: Veto.
Ross: Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made outof wheat.
Ross: Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
Ross: Fine, you go.
Ross: Huh.
Ross: Oh, veto. How aboutOoh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
Ross: Veto. Stewart?
Ross: Veto. Helen?
Ross: I dont think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on,little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?
Ross: Uh, no. No, were not.
Ross: No, no, we want to wait, right?
Ross: What? Rach! Come on, thats terrible!Theyreuhtheyre babies. Theyre-theyre all beautiful.
Ross: Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows Im talking about it.(Rachel starts to peek at the file) Dont-dont youWhWhaHey!! 
Ross: Youre looking!
Ross: I saw you!
Ross: Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Ross: No, no, no, no! Dont tell me! I dont want to know!
Ross: Momentary lapse. Dont-dont you have any self-control?
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Rach, I-I cant tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh Wait aminute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind?Unless, you know were never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. Youknow its a boy!
Ross: I dont think so! Youre just giving me Ruth so youll get toname it when its a boy, and thats when youll swoop in and name him Heathor Blaine or Sequoia.
Ross: Veto.
Ross: Unless (Rachel groans.) You anticipated that I would figure allthis out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be namedRuth! Well, Im not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
Ross: Not like this!
Ross: So, I uh I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.
Ross: Thats right. The student has become the master.
Ross: Oh, come on, you know its a girl!
Ross: You really didnt know?
Ross: No.
Ross: No.
Ross: Yes. Im Im sorry. Im so sorry.
Ross: I know! I know. You know what? Im putting Ruth back on the table!
Ross: Permission to veto.
Ross: (from outside the bathroom) Hello?
Ross: (entering) Well hey! Whats going on? Ooh, cool boat(Sees why theboats there)Oh, no. (Averts his eyes by looking around the room) (To Rachel)Hey, did you, did you tell them?
Ross: (crying) I hope youre a better father than youre a friend!!(Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs intotrouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabsRachels belly.)
Ross: Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
Ross: My God, the babys kicking. Thats great. Although Ikindawish I-I wouldve been there to feel the kicking for the first time yknow.
Ross: Look, I-I dont want to miss anymore baby stuff. SoHere.Heres my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it!Ill be there! Okay? I dont care if its three in the morning and all youwant is ice cream.
Ross: (rushes in) Is everything okay?
Ross: Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Ross: Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women dont even feel them.
Ross: Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movietheater.
Ross: No IMona!
Ross: What? Why? Whats wrong?
Ross: No really, you tell me whats up.
Ross: (To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Ross: Yeah but still, I mean it shouldve been me. Im the dad.
Ross: Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
Ross: Well yeah!
Ross: What?! What?! Rach what?!
Ross: I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
Ross: (to Rachel) I-Im sorry Rach, I didnt know. Are you gonna beokay?
Ross: I cant believe this! I shouldnt be the one making her throwup!
Ross: Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I dont know any of itand Im the father. I wish Id be more involved yknow.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can justtry it like on a temporary basis.
Ross: So? Sure! But it-it wouldnt be anything romantic. AndIm-Im dating MonaDamnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hourago! What is wrong with me?!
Ross: No! No its not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
Ross: Really?
Ross: Oh Rach thats great. Thats great. (They hug and Joey breathesa sigh of relief.)
Ross: Oh, Im actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, shes beenaway all week visiting her parents, but shell be cool. I mean, shes been sosupportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, Fossils are myfriends.
Ross: Uh, Im going to take off.
Ross: What is it?
Ross: All right. (reading the label) Candy and Cookie?
Ross: Hey, whats behind your back?
Ross: You dont want my opinion?
Ross: Come on, Im your older brother, ask me!
Ross: (quietly) The red one.
Ross: Hey! (they hug) So, how was Atlantic City?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Wha? Oh, come on. You didnt have tosaltwater taffy?! (Monalaughs) Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with seawater, but its actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. Thats notinteresting.
Ross: I do too! I missed you!
Ross: Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
Ross: Yeah! I know! It was. Oh the only sad thing is I wasnt aroundwhen it happened for the first time.
Ross: Yeah, Im missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggestedRachel move in with me.
Ross: What?
Ross: (not amused) Huhuh-huh.
Ross: (with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head andstarts to break down)
Ross: I dont know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus,she, uh, she got me taffy!
Ross: Ever?!
Ross: Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know,Im going to take her to an amazing Valentines dinner. Do all this romanticstuff, and then, just when she thinks Im the best boyfriend in the world, thenIm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
Ross: Well, Im, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
Ross: Yknow, its interesting! Most people think thats made withseawater, when in fact
Ross: (opening the door to see Mona standing there) Mona? What arehi! Whatare you doing here? Im, um, supposed to pick you up!
Ross: (he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind oflike)Ayyyayyyy!
Ross: I have no idea!
Ross: Uhlately, she just likes hanging out here.
Ross: I think shes lonely.
Ross: I know.
Ross: No, no. Shes way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
Ross: Mm-hmm. Shesshes emotional, but, but ballsy.
Ross: And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why dont you, uh,open the champagne, and Ill be right back. Ive got a surprise for you.
Ross: (fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)
Ross: (handing Mona the present) Happy Valentines Day! Or something toremember me by.
Ross: Hey, hey, man!
Ross: UhMona just dumped me.
Ross: Well, with everything thats been going on lately, I haventexactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didnt tell her I got Rachelpregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then Ilied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for notbreaking up with me sooner, you know?
Ross: Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a dateon Valentines Day? Whats going on, huh? Girl trouble?
Ross: Really?!
Ross: Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
Ross: Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Yknow, actuallyonceonce I got dumped during sex.
Ross: Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
Ross: Cmon! Joey! What is it?
Ross: Hey, hey, its me. Why cant you tell me?
Ross: Shes not a Tribbiani?
Ross: I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
Ross: Well, uh, does she like you?
Ross: Why not?
Ross: So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he still in lovewith her?
Ross: Okay. Um is he a good guy?
Ross: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Ross: Joey, its worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
Ross: Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happento you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Ross: Im going touhIm going to, um, put the bourbon in itat home.
Ross: Anyway seriously, uhjustjust talk to the guy, okay? Andtell me how it goes. (walks towards the door until)
Ross: So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he a good guy?
Ross: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Ross: Joey, its worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
Ross: Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happento you, huh? You owe it to yourself. (Walks towards the door until)
Ross: (closes the door) Did you umIm sorry, did you just sayits Rachel?
Ross: Um, youyou like Rachel?
Ross: Rachel?!
Ross: But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?! 
Ross: Its not a big deal? Oh, Im sorry I justum, Iwhatabout all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I likeyou-you cantstop thinking about her. Like how you cant sleep?
Ross: Rachel whos carrying my baby? Rachel?
Ross: Yknow what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)
Ross: (stops) I justyknowI-I just have oneRachel?! 
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Oh yknow, I stillI cant believe it. Joey and Rachel Imean its Its like you and me going out, only weirder!
Ross: Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then hed be thestepfather of my child.
Ross: Sure, because women never like Joey. Yknow, I think hes avirgin.
Ross: Hes not?
Ross: Why?
Ross: Hate him? I No, I dont hate him. (Pause) Its justits Rachel, yknow?
Ross: Okay. Okay, Ill talk to him.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: No, I dont want to hit you.
Ross: No.
Ross: No, no I dont want to do anything to you. All right? I just want totell you that Im not mad at you andand that I certainly do not hate you. Ijust, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)
Ross: Uhyeah sure. (Enters.)
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: What?! Youre in love with her.
Ross: Umm, no.
Ross: I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Ross: No, Im serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because ifshes not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
Ross: If she is where you are then uhthen my feeling weird about itshouldnt stand in the way.
Ross: Yeah. Look if-if shes gonna end up with somebody else, the truth isshe couldnt find a better guy. So
Ross: So when do you think youre gonna talk to her?
Ross: Im understanding, but lets not get carried away.
Ross: Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoysanother sip.)
Ross: (entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? Its a button down, like a,like a faded salmon?
Ross: Faded salmon color.
Ross: Great! Great. Then I mustve left it at Monas. I knew it!
Ross: Thats my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Ross: I dont know. I mean I-I guess I could. Its just that wedidnt really end things such good terms. And if I go over there Id be ignoringthe one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walksaway.)
Ross: Mona? (Theres no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers whereher extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. Helooks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to hisbrain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth tosqueal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses thekey to open the door and enter Monas apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)
Ross: Hello!!
Ross: Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Ross: (on phone) Item J437-A, color: winterberry. (Theres a knock on thedoor as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen come here, come in.(She does so.) Im so-so sorry about yesterday. I-Im really sorry. Itsjust that I (He picks up the pink shirt.)
Ross: You do?
Ross: (faking starting to cry) Oh God youre right.
Ross: (laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)
Ross: Sure. Yeah.
Ross: Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
Ross: Okay, hopefully this time mom wont boo you.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Aww that is so cool.
Ross: (picking up Chi-Chis picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog!Yknow Monica couldnt get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
Ross: You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
Ross: Ah, actually, Im sorry we-we probably should get going.
Ross: Well, there is an Arbys in the shape of a tee-pee.
Ross: So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
Ross: Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
Ross: Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.
Ross: Thats a good question, dad. Thats a good question
Ross: WhaWhat?
Ross: Dad so what we have to pretend that were married?
Ross: Can you believe that?
Ross: No, us having to lie about being married.
Ross: Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
Ross: We love marriage!
Ross: Hey
Ross: Im so we werent in the car! Did he ever let up?
Ross: (imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I musttake a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry(He looks behind him thennotices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)
Ross: That depends, how much did you hear?
Ross: What was wrong with Mona?
Ross: Yeah baby!
Ross: No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a smallwedding.
Ross: Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side)Umm. what are you doing?
Ross: Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley. 
Ross: Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium.Thats-thats where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the roomfilled with lilies, her favorite flower
Ross: Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on thesound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across thedome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"
Ross: Oh, no, Mom, its just Monica this year.
Ross: No, of course, Um Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to sayonbehalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, thatifif in 35 years, were half as happy as you guys are, well countourselves the luckiest people in the world.
Ross: and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the receptionwith you in the sidecar!
Ross: But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been noproblem?
Ross: Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: I know, I know it was stupid. 
Ross: No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. Itshow I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. 
Ross: Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like itwouldve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night
Ross: Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messedup? 
Ross: Thats all Im askin 
Ross: Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was abeautiful speech. 
Ross: Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, wedid learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there. Andyou know what? I think she was. 
Ross: Hey!

Ross: Just then or-or all the time, cause we-we have jobs yknow.
Ross: Shhh! Were not talking.

Ross: Are you serious?!
Ross: Wow! We are pretty good at this!
Ross: Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Ross: It tastes like feet!

Ross: (leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of herunborn child.
Ross: Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
Ross: Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
Ross: Yeah, you too.
Ross: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wannabe a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes(kisses Joey).
Ross: Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah!About jellyfish and how if you... (Stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! Youpeed on yourself?!
Ross: Your make-up!

Ross: Its possible, they have really sharp edges.
Ross: Wait a minute, I-I believe Im entitled to use my Angel Pass for afree turn?
Ross: Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing.
Ross: What?!
Ross: (To Chandler) You dont think its a little crazy that you getall my points just cause you
Ross: (excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler)Haaa! (To Joey) Id like a Wicked Wango card!

Ross: Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)
Ross: Well wewe dont have a garage.
Ross: Yknow what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, its not absolutely vital thatyou live with us.
Ross: Im-Im sure thats not true.
Ross: Well uh, yknow what? Even if she doesnt know anything, I do! Ihave a son. And his mother and I didnt live together, and whenever he was with me Itook care of him all the time, by myself.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Thats a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes Iwill be there toto feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I wantto do all those things.
Ross: Yes! Yes, youre gonna be so missed.
Ross: Well youre gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)
Ross: Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way.Youllyoure gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesnt believe that.) Hey!You will! Uh look, yknow when you first came to the city? You were this spoiledhelpless little girl who-who still used daddys credit card. Do you remember?
Ross: Look at you! WhatYoure-youre this big executive! You aremuch more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt youre gonnabe an incredible mother. 
Ross: Im telling you.
Ross: Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)
Ross: You sure?
Ross: All right then. (Gets up, in an announcers voice) Rachel Green!Lets play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature ofthe babys bath water?
Ross: Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Ross: Thats correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when thebaby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)
Ross: Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a WickedWango card?
Ross: Oh, Im sorry youve been Bamboozled! Youre gonna be aterrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) Ive lost sight of why weredoing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)
Ross: Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on thetable.)
Ross: No, Monicas restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They allgasp.) I didnt want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought allthe copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)
Ross: Umm
Ross: But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
Ross: Yeah, they all know.
Ross: (startling him) What?! What?
Ross: Are ya?
Ross: What are you doing up?
Ross: Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do thisafter

Ross: Okay look, theres nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time.Theres a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will gothere and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Ross: (interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if youre gonna do this, thenIm gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So (Starts for the bathroom.)
Ross: (annoyed) Yeah!
Ross: (stunned) (thinks) Well uh
Ross: Oh.
Ross: We are having a baby together, but were not involved. (The cashier,a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a whileago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks athim angrily) Or, yes stranger, wed like this delivered please.
Ross: Oh, okay.
Ross: I chose those, Im a paleontologist.
Ross: Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Ross: Thats my gym.
Ross: I am like Indiana Jones.
Ross: My son? Pretty serious. (Theres a knock on the door and Ross answersit.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?
Ross: Ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left inyour store.
Ross: Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the livingroom and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)
Ross: Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this (Themoney) back in my pocket, pretend that didnt happen. Uh yeah, actuallyIm free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or
Ross: (To Katie) Yeah, Im just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.(Katie looks worried.) Yknow because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-notbecause Im-Im into S&amp;M.

Ross: Hey.
Ross: How are you?
Ross: Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
Ross: Whats uh, whats going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
Ross: I liked her.
Ross: Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
Ross: Why? What was wrong with her?
Ross: Okay, so whats the matter?
Ross: (laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: I wont date. Ill uh, Ill be here, with you, all thetime.
Ross: True, but youre allowed to be unreasonable. Youre having ourbaby.
Ross: Do you feel better?
Ross: Uh Rach?
Ross: Just one thing umm
Ross: We live together. Youre having our baby. Im not gonna seeanybody else. Are you-are you sure you dont want something more?
Ross: Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin around! (Shes stunned) Like youdid last night when I had to pee?
Ross: (pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you
Ross: that you actually
Ross: Rach?
Ross: The bathroom?
Ross: Hey! What are you guys looking at?
Ross: Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
Ross: Now I cannot wait to see this.
Ross: Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here? (Gets up from thegreen armchair.)
Ross: Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses its themale, they carry the babies. And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea. (He sitsback down.)
Ross: (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctors appointment.
Ross: Rach, we gotta go.
Ross: People ask me why were not together, I just dont know what totell them.
Ross: Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctors keeping the officeopen late for us, but if you hurry
Ross: Really? You dont think thats a little inappropriate.(Shes wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)
Ross: Fine! Fine! Yknow what? Whatever you want. Okay? Youre themommy.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Uh-huh.
Ross: Mmm?
Ross: Wow!
Ross: Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, youve been a little short with melately. Im not trying to irritate you.
Ross: Yknow what? The doctor will be in soon, why dont we not speakuntil then.
Ross: Yknow we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how todeliver a baby thats half human and half pure evil!
Ross: (to Rachel) Oh, youre nice to her.
Ross: Do them!!
Ross: Youve got to be kidding me!
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea,caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
Ross: Its sex.
Ross: Monica!
Ross: Monica, what is the matter with you?
Ross: What?! While shes been going through this hell, youve beenmaking money?! Youre betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowersher head and shakes it yes.)

Ross: Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha Oh God! Soso hot!(Rubs his eyes.) Oh my(Laughs.) By the way, you dont want to touch the pepperand then touch your eye.
Ross: Stop it.
Ross: Im sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, Imdying.

Ross: Okay is theresome kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
Ross: Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi, this is Rachel Green.Im Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: I really think theyre out of rooms.
Ross: Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where anycountries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed byRachel.) Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm,private rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?
Ross: What-what?
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! (Hes looking at the stirrupson the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts hislegs into the stirrups.) Never done this before.

Ross: Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose toRachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybekindawantedahstartthings up again.
Ross: Look, I didnt want to rush into anything. And it seemed like shedidnt want to either. But I dont, I dont understand how any of thishappened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose,throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
Ross: Well I didnt! I didnt propose! (Pause) Unless uh (Pause)Did I? I havent slept in forty hours andit does sound like something I woulddo.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Listen, I um I heard about the engagement.
Ross: And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I umI didnt propose to you.
Ross: I dont think you do.
Ross: Poor baby, youre so tired. Rach, I didnt propose to you, Joeydidnt propose to you, and Chandler didnt propose to you.
Ross: Joey proposed to you?
Ross: Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
Ross: Wait! Whoa-whoa, youyou gave her the ring?

Ross: Uhh No.
Ross: But I-I was going to see if yknow, maybe you uh, start dating againbut thatI mean that-that was all, Rach.
Ross: No, you didnt!
Ross: (To Joey) I cant believe you told her I was going to propose!
Ross: Hey, Im not going to rush into anything!
Ross: What?
Ross: Thank you. (The nurse exits.)
Ross: Good weird?

Ross: (turns back) What! (Angrily) You didnt do anything wrong?!
Ross: Okay lets put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.)"accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again)"accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
Ross: And I can even understand that you couldnt tell Rachel, but whycouldnt you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didnt.
Ross: Not using it right, Joe.
Ross: Im gonna go.
Ross: Give me the bag.
Ross: Joey!
Ross: Im not gonna hit you.
Ross: No I dont.
Ross: No.
Ross: No!
Ross: Give me the bag.
Ross: Give me the bag.
Ross: Joey, give me the bag.
Ross: Joe Im not kidding
Ross: No!
Ross: You ducked!!
Ross: Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
Ross: What is the matter with you?!?
Ross: Why dont we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Ross: I broke my thumb.
Ross: You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries tohold the pen but cant)
Ross: Why, does it look like Im having trouble with my misshapen claw? (Hehands Joey the form)
Ross: Just Ross!
Ross: You know my birthday.
Ross: October 18th.
Ross: Actually Im a palian Dinosaurs is fine the drawing isnot.
Ross: Ah, Rachel I guess.
Ross: Just ah just put roommate.
Ross: I dont think that we are.
Ross: Well, I thought so too, but then she said shed marry you.
Ross: Yeah thats what she said.
Ross: So I dont wanna be just anybody.
Ross: You know what, its, its better this way anyway. I mean Idont know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. Its justmuch easier if were just friends who have a kid.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yes. I mean, its what we always planned.  And if you have aplan, you should stick to it.  Thats why they call them plans.  Hello?(Pause) Im fine.
Ross: Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should seehim.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: What, Rach?
Ross: (smiles) Right.
Ross: Well, thats what Im here for. (Emma starts crying again) Wantme to get that?
Ross: Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the  way over here for?
Ross: Oh my God!
Ross: Monday?!
Ross: You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this  group together!
Ross: Not you.
Ross: I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee  won't affect your milk.
Ross: Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little  question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
Ross: Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Ross: (Enters from his bedroom)Who the hell was that?!
Ross: Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning. 
Ross: Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Ross: Well, what was it?
Ross: Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any  little thing comes up. 
Ross: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a  good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
Ross: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another  doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Ross: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!  (Walks back into his room.)
Ross: (Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!
Ross: Thanks doctor.
Ross: You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of  a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Ross: He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Ross: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's  a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,  he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Ross: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security  blanket to college!
Ross: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
Ross: Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby  with the rash came in after me.
Ross: With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
Ross: Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Ross: I am a single parent.
Ross: Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the  pediatrician's office.
Ross: Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come  on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
Ross: Hey, I helped you find Waldo! 
Ross: (Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.
Ross: I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was  some guy that freaked everybody out.
Ross: Oh man.
Ross: sure.
Ross: people (shakes head, they sit) so why you all dressed  up.
Ross: oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?
Ross: you know I really admire your whole dating attitude,  it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow?  Where's this going?
Ross: but you, your so much better off you just go from  guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
Ross: There isn't that's what I'm saying. (All happy)
Ross: I know and yet here you are all ready for the next  date.
Ross: no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you  don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.
Ross: please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know  what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times.
Ross: I'm sorry I didn't catch.
Ross: Oh Ross Geller
Ross: do you have a compact in your purse?
Ross: you look great.
Ross: so how'd the date go?
Ross: So he hasn't called?
Ross: now I feel terrible this is all my fault.
Ross: We are a rare breed.
Ross: (He knocks at the door, Mike opens it) Hey Mike sorry  to just drop by like this, can I come in?
Ross: I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.
Ross: yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.
Ross: (laughs) No
Ross: Damn super cuts!
Ross: oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot  look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.
Ross: yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never  having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun,  a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
Ross: well then I didn't need to bother you or the four  other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
Ross: of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship  I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
Ross: yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about  to say Vis-à-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship  since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.
Ross: WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: YAY! (He continues the happiness with her by dancing  around) quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.
Ross: oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there  to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended  up telling him that.
Ross: umm. that you had a six year long relationship with  a guy named Vicrum.
Ross: well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in  a serious relationship.
Ross: well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know  a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer (He makes a wow face) and he  used to date Oprah. (He makes another wow face)
Ross: Good yeah just be honest with him.
Ross: I'll get it
Ross: (They kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it  up, its Ross putting on an accent pretending to be Vicrum) This is Vicrum.
Ross: So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
Rachel: Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. (to Ross:) Which one of us should go to dinner?
Ross: Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Ross: Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Ross: Alright, well just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. (hangs up) Huh, that was my mom, shes stuck in terrible traffic.
Ross: Oh, what were the other two?
Ross: I know, its the first time, were leaving the baby and  hey, I know how hard it is for you, but  but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. Shes great with kids.
Ross: Ya.
Ross: Hey, you only heard Monicas side of that. That little fatso was a terror.
Ross: Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.
Ross: Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why dont you, why dont you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then Ill meet you there.
Ross: No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. (Slang right?)
Ross: Im serious. Cmon, you should go. Here. (shoves her outside, while she tries to stay) No, uh-uh, just go.
Ross: No! No, you know what? (closes the door) You [cant get in there] (?), the babys fine, now squam (?). Yeah, [I told you a|Tell your] story walking. (?)
Ross: Oh, (door is locked) holy molly are we in a pickle now.
Ross: Okay, well the ??? is not home.
Ross: Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
Ross: I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, yyou know, everything is gonna be fine. The babys sleeping.
Ross: Cant hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
Ross: Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
Ross: You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in 609 - TOW Ross Got High, first aired 1999-11-25.)
Ross: Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think youre right. I think  listen, listen!
Ross: A pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty birds aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays (?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
Ross: Great. So lets get going?
Ross: Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
Ross: Im so sorry 
Ross: And then Rachel wasnt sure she could leave the baby.
Ross: What?
Ross: Thanks. Oh.
Ross: Yknow this ??? is incredible.
Ross: Okay, Ill have the fixed salad and the duck.
Ross: Rach, cmon, Emma is fine. Youre turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
Ross: (childish) Huh-huh, they already know it.
Ross: W-oa  Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)
Ross: Well, ??? think thats us?
Ross: You know, I think thats a good ideaour babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. (both get up) Bye, yguys.
Ross: A lot of people are thankful for those.&lt; knock on door&gt; 
Ross: Hey Amy. 
Ross: That was me.
Ross: Sure, we don't live there but...
Ross: I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
Ross: Don't say that.
Ross: Sure, you want to go upstairs?
Ross: You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like  the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
Ross: Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I  don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job. 
Monica to Ross: Hi.
Ross: Emma. 
Ross: Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would  want Monica and Chandler. 
Ross: well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma  would go to my parents. 
Ross: Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like  Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict. 
Ross: No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're  strongest when.. when you're together. 
Ross: Sure, Monica would have to give her up. 
Ross: Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
Ross: Emma. 
Rachel turns to Ross: Oh whose side are you on? &lt;back  to Amy&gt; I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle  the responibility of a child. 
Monica screaming at Ross: Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't  time! 
Ross: Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel  dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma. 
Ross: So, so now do I get Joey?
Ross: You're really not coming back?
Ross: I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Ross: You got me a cola drink?
Ross: Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Ross: Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Ross: What are you doing here, Santa?
Ross: I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Ross: (to Chandler) What are you doing?
Ross: Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
Ross: Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Ross: I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
Ross: (in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!
Ross: (in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!
Ross: Really? You're not gonna return it?
Ross: Wow, it really is!
Ross: Oh my god...
Ross: What, you, you really quit your job?
Ross: Oh, hey...
Ross: (reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
Ross: Hey you guys!
Ross: Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points   to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Ross: Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Ross: Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there   in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me   feel like I earned it.
Ross: Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you   - wovyou dovyou ...
Ross: Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just   forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
Ross: What are you, a child?
Ross: Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy   on someone else.
Ross: Whazzup??
Ross: Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep   an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Ross: Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked   for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
Ross: You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm   sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do   this for me?
Ross: Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause) 
Ross: I am, yes.
Ross: Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Ross: We have to stop them before something happens!
Ross: Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
Ross: Thanx.
Ross: What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Ross: Yeah, come on in. Molly?
Ross: Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have   no problem.
Ross: Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Ross: OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Ross: OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
Ross: Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !
Ross: Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
Ross: No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!
Ross: I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
Ross: Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.
Ross: Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Ross: That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Ross: I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
Ross: No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
Ross: No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
Ross: You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!
Ross: You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...
Ross: Don't you have to be at work?
Ross: Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here’s a question: "Would you...would you rather drown or be burnt alive?"
Ross: Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace
Ross: Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
Ross: This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
Ross: I know! (he stands)
Ross: But, what’s great is that you don’t mind talking about it.
Ross: Uh-ah!
Ross: (pfew). Good choice Ross.
Ross: Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
Ross: Oh, yeah, yeah that’s Michelle.
Ross: Oh, just this woman I’ve been seeing.
Ross: Yeah, didn’t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven’t being going out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.
Ross: How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that’smy roommate, Rachel.
Ross: I told you about my daughter.
Ross: I told you it wasn’t long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
Ross: Are you kidding?
Ross: We’ll see.
Ross: I don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
Ross: Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
Ross: When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
Ross: Ok, Michelle, it’s time to go.
Ross: Ok.
Ross: You know, if it’s meant to be, I’ll guess it. Bye, bye.
Ross: Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.
Ross: Oh, really!
Ross: Oh, really!
Ross: What about the guy from the bar?
Ross: The guy you gave your number to.
Ross: Because he called here looking for you. So don’t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You’ve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn’t even have the courtesy to tell me.
Ross: What?
Ross: Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Ross: I never gave it to you.
Ross: I don’t know.
Ross: Who am I?
Ross: I am the guy who’s taking care of our baby while you’re out at bars meeting guys!
Ross: None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That’s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn’t tell anyone!
Ross: Uh, clearly.
Ross: Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
Ross: Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you      tonight?
Ross: Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Yeah, that'll do it.
Ross: I'm, I'm okay. 
Ross: Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have      worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's      a divorce.
Ross: No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel      and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing      other people.
Ross: Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good      for me...
Ross: Yeah? Any names come to mind?
Ross: Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height,      dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
Ross: Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
Ross: Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home      alone.
Ross: Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
Ross: No! 
Ross: Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
Ross: Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to      have sex tonight.
Ross: Just the crab cakes.
Ross: What's - what's going on?
Ross: What? You - you're making money off my misery?
Ross: This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life.      Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
Ross: Hey, what's wrong?
Ross: Oh. Crab cake?
Ross: Well, what happened?
Ross: Monica told me you had a blind date.
Ross: I did, too.
Ross: But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Ross: Why does everyone keep saying that?
Ross: That bad?
Ross: Female body inspector? What size is that?
Ross: The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
Ross: Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's      just stupid.
Ross: I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the      chances?
Monica, Chandler, Ross: Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Ross: I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great!  I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
Ross: Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for  all hanging out but to come to my home!
Ross: Why?
Ross: Never?
Ross: wow, are you still going to move in with him?
Ross: Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight  and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
Ross: No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now  but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Ross: If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer".  It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love  to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before  she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
Ross: But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have  so much fun and you love Mike.
Ross: Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and  you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
Ross: The Divorcer, to the rescue!
Ross: Yeah I just hurt it.
Ross: Hey! What do you guys think about this. "Ross: The Divorce-Force".
Ross: Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the  other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
Ross: Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised  I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
Ross: Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in  the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly  picture yourself in a Volvo?
Ross: I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
Ross: Hey hey, can I help?
Ross: You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Ross: Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Ross: Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
Ross: It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
Ross: Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident... 
Ross: No... I already e-mailed her.
Ross: You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Ross: (he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
Ross: (he comes back) Alright, let's go!
Ross: I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
Ross: (yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??
Ross: That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  (pause) It's not funny!!
Ross: I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Ross: You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Ross: Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
Ross: (visibly upset) I'm dead?
Ross: Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Ross: Oh please, hit by a blimp?
Ross: Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
Ross: You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
Ross: uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)
Ross: Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
Ross: What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Ross: I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
Ross: You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Ross: Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
Ross: No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Ross: oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man... 
Ross: It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
Ross: Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)
Ross: Who is he?
Ross: I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)
Ross: (coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?
Ross: It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
Ross: Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Ross: (sceptical) Yeah... 
Ross: (he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
Ross: Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
Ross: (on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?
Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross: yeah thats a greatidea!
Ross: No thanks!
Ross: (in a  mocking voice)Uh...sure I do, and I also wannabe King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Ross: The woman just vanished!
Ross: No! Do you know what your odds are of winning thelottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck bylightning 42 times.
Ross: Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going tospend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
Ross: Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we'retrying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
Ross: (yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they'retowing your car!!
Ross: (panting)They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
Ross: Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we couldall go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancingon top of it!
Ross: (to Monica)Think he washed his hands?
Ross: (mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your24 state lottery!
Ross: (mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someoneelse a chance!
Ross: You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true,but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rubthis lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thinggets hot!!
Ross: Uh, you're not gonna win.
Ross: Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing likethat.
Ross: Why would I eat my own arm?
Ross: Why?
Ross: You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But justthe fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet!Come here (they kiss and hug)
Ross: I don't know, probably just invest it.
Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cooland piss it all away" (Joey and Chandler pleased)
Ross: (to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce thenumbers, Mommy?
Ross: Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy"when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
Ross: Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably callme "Daddy" too.
Ross: I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Ross: (tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have youbeen a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't.
Ross: I can't believe this, I thought we were all in thistogether!
Ross: 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Ross: Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! Andif I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
Ross: (trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!
Ross: Monica!
Ross: Go, go, go!!
Ross: Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about thescary pigeon...
Ross: Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
Ross: (on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. Andremember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel)Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver toRachel)
Ross: Oh, we have one too!!
Ross: (calling Rachel) Come on!!
Ross: Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
Ross: Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Ross: Okay, what does it mean?
Ross: I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter'sfirst words (goes back to checking the tickets).
Ross: Yes you did, gleba is a word!
Ross: Ok, use it in a sentence.
Ross: It's not a word!
Ross: Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it shesaid another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up:pbbqqt....
Ross: She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head,very moved)
Ross: Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart themepark.
Monica and Ross: Seven.
Ross: Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
Ross: I guess if everybody else is...
Ross: Hi!
Ross: I'd love to!
Ross: Phoebe, what happened?
Ross: Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
Ross: Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
Ross: Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
Ross: (browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!
Ross: (in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!
Ross: Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
Ross: (high pitched voice) Check again please!
Ross: Not there.
Ross: (mumbling) She doesn't know what to say!
Ross: Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Ross: Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
Ross: C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Ross: I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
Ross: (on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. 
Ross: What did you get?
Ross: Nice, put it with the others.
Ross: We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!  
Ross: Oh, that's not cool.
Ross: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish I'd thought this through.
Ross: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
Ross: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
Ross: Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Ross: At least tell me where you hid it.
Ross: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
Ross: Oh my god.
Ross: There's something new in the bowl.
Ross: No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
Ross: It's not the same.
Ross: (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.
Ross: Oh, my maple candy!
Ross: (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
Ross: Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)
Ross: What? How come that you don't have to go!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
Ross: (covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
Ross: It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
Ross: (looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede.
Ross: Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
Ross: Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
Ross: Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
Ross: Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
Ross: (hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
Ross: I don't think so.
Ross: Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?
Ross: You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
Ross: Oh, damn it!
Ross: (very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
Ross: (to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!
Ross: So basically all nuts?
Ross: I've lost the will to live.
Ross: What?
Ross: Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
Ross: (entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
Ross: Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
Ross: (to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?
Ross: Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
Ross: Really? Wh-what's wrong?
Ross: I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
Ross: (looking at them) Wh-what's going on?
Ross: No, I arranged that...
Ross: (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Ross: Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Ross: You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Ross: ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Ross: Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Ross: (very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood".
Ross: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Ross: (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
Ross: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
Ross: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
Ross: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
Ross: (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
Ross: She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
Ross: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
Ross: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) "Can we walk"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?
Ross: What? (turns around to look at Rachel)
Ross: Nice to meet you.
Ross: Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
Ross: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
Ross: I'd lead with that.
Ross: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
Ross: It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
Ross: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
Ross: And sexy.
Ross: Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
Ross: Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
Ross: (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
Ross: I'm smarter than him!
Ross: Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
Ross: Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did   not kiss.
Ross: Why do you care so much?
Ross: Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each   other's tonsils...
Ross: Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with   it...
Ross: Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
Ross: I'm gonna get some more coffee.
Ross: Ok. (they both go)
Ross: Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean,   you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like   someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
Ross: Yeah, I know the type.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?
Ross: Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious"   means, just don't use it!
Ross: Get to the problem!
Ross: (looking down) Are you wearing two belts?
Ross: You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Ross: You know, I really don't want to   get involved in you guy's relationship.
Ross: (after a short hesitation) Fine.
Ross: Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
Ross: Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Ross: Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry   baseball fans!
Ross: Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore   on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,   you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the   Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that   she'd love.
Ross: But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for   Thai food...
Ross: Ok.
Ross: Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities   wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Ross: Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
Ross: Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt   M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Ross: Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time   for this.
Ross: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say,   I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Ross: Wow. What does that mean?
Ross: Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Ross: Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing   and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
Ross: No! (Slaps his hand)
Ross: Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
Ross: (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor   R. Geller. (hits &lt;return&gt;, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the   sofa) Hey!
Ross: Hey, how was the Met?
Ross: Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
Ross: What do you mean?
Ross: (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked   into the Met, did you go to the right?
Ross: (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like   you guys are having a great time together.
Ross: What?
Ross: What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
Ross: (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey   a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about   art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
Ross: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all   that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You   know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
Ross: That was going to be my next argument.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Glad I could help man.
Ross: (entering) Hey, you guys!
Ross: Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Ross: Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?
Ross: Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
Ross: Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
Ross: Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).
Ross: Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
Ross: It's in Barbados.
Ross: So-so what did the doctor say?
Ross: How do you feel about all this?
Ross: (puzzled) What?
Ross: (looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
Ross: The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
Ross: (reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
Ross: Oh, that's not what you want...
Ross: Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Ross: I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Ross: It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
Ross: Barbados.
Ross: What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Ross: I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
Ross: (To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
Ross: Oh, that's right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
Ross: (to Emma) Can you say Barbados?
Ross: Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! (he gives them their passes) This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Ross: Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
Ross: Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Ross: It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
Ross: (very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!
Ross: Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
Ross: Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... "Dear..." (he takes the notepad)
Ross: "... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
Ross: Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
Ross: Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: (Excited) You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Ross: Yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to Charlie) No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Ross: Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Ross: (to Charlie) Ready to go?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (a little embarassed by their conversation) I'm good, I have dinner plans (moves away from them).
Ross: Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
Ross: By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
Ross: Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler).
Ross: The chocolates aren't here yet.
Ross: If you want to check your email, just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)
Ross: Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)
Ross: What, oh my God. What did you do?
Ross: Why, why would you open it?
Ross: What did it say?
Ross: What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
Ross: NO! I don't!!
Ross: Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Ross: Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
Ross: Get out! (Chandler runs out)
Ross: Well, what do you do?
Ross: I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Ross: I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
Ross: Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Ross: Alright, ok, let's do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
Ross: Yeah, that's it?
Ross: Oh my God, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)
Ross: Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) That's a pretty necklace.
Ross: Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)
Ross: Oh my God, I love you.
Ross: That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: No. (they clink glasses and drink)
Ross: (embarassed) Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
Ross: Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Ross: Hey! High-five! (they high-five)
Ross: My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Ross: I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: "Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
Ross: And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
Ross: (embarassed) Me neither.
Ross: Yep, we got it, we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much.
Ross: Good night.
Ross: (from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin, guys!
Ross: Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Ross: Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
Ross: And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
Ross: But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
Ross: ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
Ross: (concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!
Ross: Oh, thanks guys!
Ross: Oh!
Ross: (with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)
Ross: Oh, thank you so much!
Ross: (puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
Ross: (skating over, embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Ross: Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?
Ross: No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Ross: (joking) I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Ross: (realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) Look, I took it too far!
Ross: Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (Mr. Oberblau giggles)
Ross: Get Out!
Ross: Yes, please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) So, what's going on?
Ross: Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Ross: I knew that was him!
Ross: (holding her hand) Hey, you ok?
Ross: Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
Ross: (standing) Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO, GO, GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Ross: I don't think they saw us.
Ross: (apparently unruffled) Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Ross: I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
Ross: I'm sorry... we... we can't.
Ross: I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. (pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)
Ross: (looking at Monica's legs) WOW!
Ross: I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
Ross: Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
Ross: (laughing) Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
Ross: Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean,  it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
Ross: So, do you get colours or just French tips?
Ross: Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey, I know where this  place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he  is saying) florist. (he goes away)
Ross: Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Ross: Two, I think a two.
Ross: Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
Ross: Well, I have a PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not  impressed by this statement)  (Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. He stands up  in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)
Ross: One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer  starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've  not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)
Ross: You sprayed my front twice!
Ross: No, I barely even  got to three Mississippi. 
Ross: Mississippilesly? (pause) Well, how  bad is it?
Ross: So, how dark is it  gonna get?
Ross: I'm a four?
Ross: (sarcastically) Really!
Ross: (annoyed) Ok!
Ross: Wait, wait a minute, there's no light  on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns  and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns  again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out  of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing  happened again!
Ross: (hysterically) I'm an eight!
Ross: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Ross: Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler  and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body,  where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)
Ross: (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?
Ross: (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel  just enters, sees him and starts laughing)
Ross: (Still yelling) I Know!
Ross: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does  it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them  all on my back.
Ross: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one  is it?
Ross: Which... which... which... Which one is it?
Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Ross: Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
Ross: Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Ross: Dude, you're not tanned.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: No.
Ross: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Ross: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing   weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Ross: (he enters) Hey guys!
Ross: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Ross: Ah, and where is Joey?
Ross: (taping Joey with the cam) Hey, there is uncle Joey!
Ross: Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
Joey: 18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his "How You Doin'"   line)Ross: Joey, NO!
Ross: When they see this you'll be 52!
Ross: (points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey!
Judy: (to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the   attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to   take him to the emergency room!Ross: (pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know   about your dad!
Ross: Oh, great!
Ross: Thank you so much for that gift!
Ross: Amazing... amazing.
Ross: Sure.
Ross: Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say   for bachelorette parties?
Ross: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
Ross: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the   penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!
Ross: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could   go and get the cake.
Ross: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message   to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica   and Chandler) Ok!
Ross: You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be   back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
Ross: (Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some   more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right   there. (Puts the phone down)
Ross: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot   her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
Ross: No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad   that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes   back here and all you guys are gone?
Ross: Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)
Ross: RACHEL!
Ross: (sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a   good driver.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.   (he opens the box)
Ross: Rach, she's not going to remember this.
Ross: (looks back at the cake) Hey!
Ross: It's not bad.
Ross: Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this   to make ears.
Ross: Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into   woodland creatures.
Ross: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Ross: Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
Ross: Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Ross: Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow   out the candle. Come on Emma.
Ross: What's wrong? Are you okay?
Ross: Okay, you ready?
Ross: A-a-and... record.
Ross: Hey...
Ross: (surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love to   but I really have to grade these papers.
Ross: (Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B!
Ross: Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Ross: Damnit!
Ross: (he opens the door) Hi Amy!
Ross: Still sharp as a tack!
Ross: (pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together   last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Ross: (gives up) Yes, yes, you did.
Ross: Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need  pec implants! 
Ross: Ehm... Her name is Emma.
Ross: What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Ross: (to Joey) Oh my God!
Ross: What... what you working on?
Ross: Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
Ross: Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word   you want to change.  Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list   of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
Ross: Seriously?
Ross: Well, do you wanna marry him?
Ross: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had?   Because my throat's been hurting?
Ross: I don't think that's what this is.
Ross: (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other   side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
Ross: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Ross: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
Ross: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Ross: (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Ross: I... I don't know..
Ross: Hey guys. Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.
Ross: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see.   (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).
Ross: Why not?
Ross: Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!
Ross: (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?
Ross: (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from   him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he   realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons. 
Ross: Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have   left Emma with her!
Ross: That's not a thing!
Ross: (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
Ross: (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!
Ross: Pheebs, what's wrong?
Ross: So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared,   or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah, big surprise,   I like proposals!
Ross: (to Charlie) Hey!
Ross: Guess who's a finalist for a huge research  grant!  I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you. 
Ross: Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds   of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not    that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Ross: Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get   it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there   will be  an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah!   That'll be  the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious   questions   about my work!
Ross: Yeah. Why?
Ross: Your ex-boyfriend?
Ross: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new   boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
Ross: Well, if you think it would help.
Ross: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know,   butter him up? Anything he really likes?
Ross: We'll see how dinner goes.
Ross: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart.   I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner   party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley   or C3PO?
Ross: Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
Ross: I'm ok.
Ross: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell   you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,   (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of   the reasons I got into the field.
Ross: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image,   you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz,   mmm.
Ross: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
Ross: See, there are still several areas that haven't   been fully excavated.
Ross: What?
Ross: Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?
Ross: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
Ross: Are you serious?
Ross: No!
Ross: (Rolls his eyes) I guess!
Ross: (shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I...   (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's wrong? Answer the question")
Ross: (annoyed) May 12th?
Ross: (even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students. 
Ross: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my   questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
Ross: (annoyed) um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
Ross: (stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it   correctly) B - O - S ...
Ross: Oh come on!!
Ross: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology   related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling)   Aunt Margaret's pants size?
Ross: (Sarcastic) No! Stop! 
Ross: (Skeptical) Really?
Ross: I have to break up with Charlie?
Ross: You're crazy.
Ross: Crazy!
Ross: (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)
Ross: Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
Ross: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your   ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
Ross: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't   give you up.
Ross: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,   who was the voice of "Underdog"?
Ross: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay?   I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do   you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Ross: Damnit!
Ross: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you   tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the   voice of Underdog!
Ross: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in   the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Ross: Too little, too late, Benji!
Ross: (indignant) No!
Ross: What?
Ross: or...
Ross: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a   little uncomfortable.
Ross: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
Ross: Hey you guys!
Ross: Hey, what are you doing?
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact   that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
Ross: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
Ross: I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Ross: No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But   maybe the time after that!
Ross: (he enters) Hi!
Ross: Oh, good!
Ross: Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists   out there.
Ross: There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under   a bridge!
Ross: Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Ross: Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and   fire!
Ross: Be-caaauuuse...
Ross: Seriously?
Ross: (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you   in the movie!
Ross: Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly   safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and   you'll see!
Ross: Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look, please, just come   on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you   won’t regret it.
Ross: Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their   irrational fears on their children, do you?
Ross: Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different   species of poisonous swings!
Ross: Ok.
Ross: Rach, she’s got like three hairs!
Ross: I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this. 
Ross: Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)
Ross: See, I told you!
Ross: Oh, absolutely!
Ross: Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared   of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow!
Ross: SON OF A BITCH! (turns to his right to see three kids staring at him)   (To the   kids) Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! (They go away)
Ross: No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault   and kind   of that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault. Who is still laughing.   Nice. 
Ross: No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing,   okay? And   you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of. 
Ross: Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your   silly   fears.
Ross: Good.
Ross: (He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT?   WHERE? WHERE?
Ross: I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,     afraid)
Ross: (nervously) Ok...
Ross: (Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok,   get on the swing!
Ross: See?
Ross: There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used   to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
Ross: Well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of   the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
Ross: (he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) How does this look?
Ross: C'mon! This looks good!
Ross: Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Ross: Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress. 
Ross: You're wearing the same shirt.
Ross: You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous! 
Ross: Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).
Ross: (feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Ross: Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
Ross: Wow!
Ross: Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket, “boys will be boys”) Boys will be boys?
Ross: All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.
Ross: Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Ross: Really?
Ross: So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Ross: (to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)
Ross: (not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Ross: Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Ross: You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!
Ross: Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Ross: Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)
Ross: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
Ross: Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Ross: Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Ross: (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Ross: So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: All right, we'll work it out.
Ross: Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?
Ross: Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every   day. How can I be okay with this?
Ross: Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back,   she would take it?
Ross: I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas   party. We really hit it off.
Ross: I didn't say we were brothers.
Ross: Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas   party about two years ago.
Ross: Close. Ron. (shakes hands)
Ross: Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Ross: Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll   see if she wants to come back.
Ross: Look, she loved her job here. And let's face   it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that   true?
Ross: (surprised) Huh, I took a shot there.
Ross: I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his   way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one   up.) Is this your son?
Ross: Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does   little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance? 
Ross: How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after   everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants.   (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s   not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there   with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
Ross: You let Rachel come back, and it’s done. 
Ross: Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear,   your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Ross: He’ll be fine.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep   without it.
Ross: Ok.
Ross: Nooo!
Ross: So, you’re not going to Paris.
Ross: Wh… wh…what?
Ross: Yeeeah! (They high-five) 
Ross: (enters) It's me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed)   Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might   be able to get her to come back. 
Ross: Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? (looks   hopeful)
Ross: Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this (Takes   a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.
Ross: Huh? So? We have a deal?
Ross: Yes! yes! 
Ross: Oh, (grins) Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
Ross: Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. (shakes his head, give him a thumbs   up and leaves)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: What?
Ross: They did?
Ross: So, what are you gonna do?
Ross: That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Ross: You're excited, right?
Ross: Right!
Ross: Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.   Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Ross: (after a long pause) You should go.
Ross: It's what you want. You should go.
Ross: I really do.
Ross: (picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in   the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) I'm sure he'll   understand.
Ross: Yeah...
Ross: Yeah, yeah, oh! (They hug)
Ross: Then I'm happy too. (They're still hugging - fade out)
