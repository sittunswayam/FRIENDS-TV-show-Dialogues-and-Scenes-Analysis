Joey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There'sgotta be something wrong with him!
Joey: Instead of...?
Joey: Never had that dream.
Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Joey: Ohh.
Joey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Joey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot ofpain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have somehormones!
Joey: I say push her down the stairs. 
Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Joey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Joey: What, like there's a rule or something?
Joey: Who's Paul?
Monica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a realdate' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Joey:  Hey, Paul!
Joey: Here's a little tip, shereally likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again untilit starts to get a little red.
Joey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Joey: I'm thinking we've got abookcase here.
Joey: (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
Joey: Which goes where?
Joey: Done with the bookcase!
Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you'regonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Joey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got thefurniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Joey: You got screwed.
Joey: Shut up!
Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'?That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is thebest thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Joey: Great story!  But, I uh,I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)
Joey: Right.  Thanks. It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)
Joey: Congratulations. 
Joey: Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feellike you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste thecoffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not thathungry...
Joey: Morning, Paul.
Joey: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do youdo on a real date?
Joey: Yeah, I'm an actor.
Joey: I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Joey: Look, it was a job all right?
Joey: I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the doorand opens it to leave.)
Joey: You should both know,that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) 
Joey: (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line! 
Joey: (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Joey: I can't believe what I'm hearing here. 
Joey: Oh, you wouldn't know a greatbutt if it came up and bit ya.
Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious? 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly everytime they come. 
Chandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!
Joey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Joey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Joey: Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means'It is you'. 
Joey: Yeah. Cushions the blow. 
Joey: "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have tolive with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." 
Joey: Thanks! Let's keep going. 
Joey: "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I cansmoke." 
Joey: What? 
Joey: Whoah! 
Joey: Hey! 
Joey: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. 
Joey: Y'miss it? 
Joey: That's ridiculous! 
Joey: Y'okay, Phoebe? 
Joey: What are you talking about? Keep it! 
Joey: So when do we get to meet the guy? 
Joey: Let it go, Ross. 
Joey: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! 
Joey: (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here! 
Joey: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. 
Joey: Alan. 
Joey: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 
Joey: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews herhair? 
Joey: Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"? 
Joey: Do you have any respect for your body? 
Joey: (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's goingon? 
Joey: Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. 
Joey: Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.) 
Joey: So that's it? It's over? Just like that? 
Joey: Okay! 
Joey: Probably kill myself! 
Joey: Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got noreason to live! 
Joey: You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. 
Joey: ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. 
Joey: (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're takingyou. 
Joey: We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) 
Joey: So? 
Joey: What's wrong with the twentieth? 
Joey: The hell with hockey, let's all do that! 
Joey: C'mon, Ross! 
Joey: Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. 
Joey: Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there'sthe pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) 
Joey: What? 
Joey: -Peaches? 
Joey: Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. 
Joey: C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. 
Joey: Well, how long do you think it'll be? 
Joey: He's right, enough, already. What is the bigdeal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with herfor seven years after that. 
Joey: What? 
Joey: With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
Joey: Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! Therewas a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! 
Joey: Man. Can you believe he's only had sex withone woman? 
Joey: Really? 
Joey: Oh, ah- the kid has it. 
Joey: Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want.You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Joey: No plans, huh?
Joey: Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. 
Joey: My god, Angela.
Joey: No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. OneMississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over toher) Hey, Angela. 
Joey: You look good.
Joey: You don't say.
Joey: Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Joey: Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like,talking too.
Joey: What?
Joey: Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner togethertonight? You know, as friends?
Joey: You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Joey: Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Joey: Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He'ssmart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month andcall myself an actor, but Bob is...
Joey: What?
Joey: Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybeAngela will come back to me.
Joey: (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken upwith her. Will you help me? Please?
Joey: Yep.
Joey: Which what?
Joey: No, but he's...
Joey: Oh my god.
Joey: I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Joey: So, you and Angela, huh?
Joey: You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cutenibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Joey: Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Joey: Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Joey: What?
Joey: Come on, they're close.
Joey: Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Joey: Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Joey: All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Joey: Ow!
Joey: Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Joey: Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us,we can break them up.
Joey: Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Joey: Excellent.
Joey: Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say,your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.) 
Joey: Whadja think?
Joey: C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I didwith the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Joey: The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybethey wanna sign me!
Joey: Who's Rick?
Joey: I couldn't do it.
Joey: When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out withmore people than she is.
Joey: (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (Hehangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent hasjust gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Joey: Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor!"I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out oforder!"
Joey: "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Joey: ...I'm his (mumbles)
Joey: ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goesinto the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Joey: C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that'sbig!
Joey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Joey: Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Joey: Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Joey: Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)
Joey: Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Joey: Me?
Joey: Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe islost.
Joey: Well, I'm- I'm showering.
Joey: Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, hiswife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Joey: I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
Joey: Nope.
Joey: I got fired.
Joey: Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Noweverybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Joey: My mom will.
Joey: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finallyget my shot, and I blow it!
Joey: Hard to tell, I was naked.
Joey: Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)
Joey: Hi everyone.
Joey: Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles wehave, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Joey: What's up man?
Joey: (to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with JillGoodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)
Joey: OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the secondfloor of the New York CIty public library.
Joey: We have a winner!
Joey: It's never gonna happen.
Joey: You and Rachel.
Joey: Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friendzone. 
Joey: Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Joey: Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you'rethinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Joey: Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight?You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into theroom behind them)
Joey: Are you going to do it?
Joey: Do you want any help?
Joey: Good luck, man.
Joey: OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)
Joey: Hey, where are you going?
Joey: You can't go out there.
Joey: Because of... the reason.
Joey: I, um, can't tell you.
Joey: OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I toldyou.
Joey: He's planning your birthday party.
Joey: (as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.
Joey: Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
Joey: Sorry, that was wax.
Joey: (does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!
Joey: Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you haveto throw a party for Monica.
Joey: Not me.
Joey: Twice?
Joey: You guys okay?
Joey: Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you'redead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay,huh?
Joey: (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?
Joey: What?
Joey: Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)
Joey: No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Joey: (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearingdisability.
Joey: Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Joey: Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Joey: Hey, hey.
Joey: Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
Joey: You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Joey: No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers) 
Joey: Thanks.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: (to Monica) We did?
Joey: Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
Joey: Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.(pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis? 
Joey: I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Joey: I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Joey: Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Joey: Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Joey: What's wrong?
Joey: Oh. What?
Joey: Wait, wait, wait!
Joey: So I guess you all saw it.
Joey: Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Joey: Chandler, will you just come in already?
Joey: Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Joey: But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a littlepiece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can'tbe with my family because of my disease.
Joey: The balloon?
Joey: Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Joey: That tone will not make me go any faster.
Joey: That one will. 
Joey: Nope, not that one.
Joey: Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Joey: Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Joey: You call that delicious? 
Joey: I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Joey: Oh, I will.
Joey: The bigger half.
Joey: Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Joey: I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not evenjolly, it's all political.
Joey: Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face,y'know?
Joey: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Joey: Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Joey: Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)
Joey: You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Joey: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Joey: Uh, four.
Joey: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf todo?
Joey: Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a youngergirl)...You brought your kids.
Joey: Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Joey: Hey, kids...
Joey: (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Joey: There y'go, kids.
Joey: You seen Sandy?
Joey: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Joey: Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Joey: Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.
Joey: I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Joey: C'mon, she's your mom!
Joey: Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Right. No big deal.
Joey: In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Joey: You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin'aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Joey: Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Joey: Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Joey: Ross, how could you let this happen?
Joey: You don't think my mom's sexy?
Joey: I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day,alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Joey: He forgot to leave his grip size!
Joey: So are you gonna tell him?
Joey: How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Joey: Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Joey: Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Joey: Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knowswhat woulda happened.
Joey: Me neither, y'know what-
Joey: What are you mad at me for?!
Joey: (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) Seewhat happens when you break the code?
Joey: Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)
Joey: (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father ontheir wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Joey: C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Joey: (Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.
Joey: Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, abouteverything.
Joey: No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being amom?"
Joey: Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow upand realise I have a bomb?"
Joey: That makes more sense.
Joey: I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back tothe door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)
Joey: Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walkingaway... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Joey: You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Joey: Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?(measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-likevoice) Hi Daddy! 
Joey: (in baby-like voice) How come you don't live with Mommy? (pause;shows Ross less than amused) How come Mommy lives with that other lady? (pause; Ross stilllooks less than amused; Joey smiling) What's a lesbian? (playfully hits Ross)
Joey: I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes,and their little baby hands... 
Joey: Need a new table.
Joey: That's the rule.
Joey: How'd you get to that?
Joey: You knew about that?
Joey: Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Joey: Yeah
Joey: Why not?
Joey: Why, are you moving out?
Joey: You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Joey: Aw, I know all about Kip!
Joey: Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Joey: So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up andwaves arms frantically in protest)
Joey: Or an uncle... 
Joey: Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Joey: Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
Joey: Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Joey: Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to atable)
Joey: So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outsideagain?" Of course!
Joey: I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eatsomething."
Joey: All right, how about the ladybugs?
Joey: Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Joey: Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Joey: No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-thereteam.
Joey: Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks outof there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he'snot! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Joey: Wha-
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Joey: Oh yeah!
Joey: Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Joey: Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)
Joey: (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr.Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?
Joey: Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)
Joey: Since then?!
Joey: ...I d'know.
Joey: You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)
Joey: Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Joey: It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading thisdouble life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd becool.... This blows!
Joey: What's the matter with Rog?
Joey: Night, you guys.
Joey: Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Joey: I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Joey: Dad, Ronni's here.
Joey: Who-ah-ho.
Joey: No you won't.
Joey: If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here whereI can keep an eye on you.
Joey: That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you'reunder my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with yourgirlfriend.
Joey: Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Joey: Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make achange. This has gone on long enough.
Joey: Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Joey: Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Joey: I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Joey: Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. 
Joey: I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top ofgirls...
Joey: Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy andgo the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Joey: No.
Joey: You really think so?
Joey: Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)
Joey: (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!
Joey: Ma! What're you doing here?
Joey: Oww! Big ring!
Joey: Hold on, you-you knew?
Joey: So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Joey: Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talkingabout?! I mean, what about you?
Joey: I'm...happy...for you?
Joey: Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
Joey: Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Joey: With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.
Joey: Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keeppretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see herhusband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do withanything except that I found out today.
Joey: Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Joey: Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.(He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monicain a towel)
Joey: Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Joey: I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Joey: You're in!
Joey: Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Joey: Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'mreturning your egg."
Joey: Think it'll work?
Joey: Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Joey: No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' outwith me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Joey: Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she'svulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up andeats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin'this.
Joey: (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?
Joey: No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out withLorraine. Just calm down. 
Joey: (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and Ican't go when I'm nervous.
Joey: Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Joey: (to Lorraine) We can't do that.
Joey: Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Joey: Uh, we might be leaving now.
Joey: She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'mnot even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Joey: You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Joey: I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry,Chandler.
Joey: (in disbelief) Whoa.
Joey: I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Joey: (to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will.
Joey: Thank you.
Joey: So what're you going to do?
Joey: How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Joey: (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...(gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?
Joey: I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take onelook at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Joey: (tasting) Mmmm. Good.
Joey: It's creamier.
Joey: I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'mkeeping it down, y'know?
Joey: Uh-oh.
Joey: (in disbelief) Vulva?
Joey: (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Joey: What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what youwant her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'lltell you what. Just try something on me.
Joey: Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd liketo be doing right now.
Joey: ....yeah... what else?

Joey: Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Joey: Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? 
Joey: You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Joey: Oh, it is.
Joey: It is.
Joey: Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Joey: (panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Joey: Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder,harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey,hey, ho, ho. Let's (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) I wasjustyeah, right. Push! Push!

Joey: Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
Joey: He doesn't do much, does he?
Joey: Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Joey: I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Joey: Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some...research.
Joey: Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Joey: (sigh)... It's a fertility study.
Joey: Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, Ijust go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey,but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Joey: We make fire. Cook meat.
Joey: Oh, OK.
Joey: I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Joey: What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Joey: Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Joey: Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according tothe rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonalexperiments, if you know what I mean.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: The country?
Joey: Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Joey: He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Joey: Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Joey: We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but...I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)
Joey: Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Joey: Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we'regonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Joey: Then you do. Heh, heh.
Joey: What do you mean?
Joey: Not following you.
Joey: (to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.
Joey: (pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head.That'll turn back time.
Joey: Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn'tmind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Joey: The country.
Joey: He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's thekind of thing that can wait.
Joey: Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Joey: (panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's giveyou another turn.
Joey: Sure! Why not?
Joey: How do you mean?
Joey: Shhhh!
Joey: She's still asleep.
Joey: Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Joey: Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes megreat. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it waslike a ticker tape parade!
Joey: It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, allof a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I wasable to appreciate it on another level.
Joey: I know! Neither did I!
Joey: Seven hundred bucks!
Joey: Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like Ilearned something.
Joey: What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walkaround like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)
Joey: Um, this?
Joey: What up?!
Joey: (answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it'sJulie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)
Joey: Needs some clothes altered?
Joey: Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. Hedid my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) Allright, when was 1990?
Joey: (to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen.
Joey: No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again.
Joey: Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Joey: Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.He'll know what it means.
Joey: Can we see her?
Joey: How're you doing?
Joey: Ooh, that bad, huh? 
Joey: Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It'sone of my gifts.
Joey: You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Joey: What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has beenin love with you for like 10 years.
Joey: Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've beenwith like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone theway Ross felt about you.
Joey: Frankie? What're you talking about?
Joey: No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Joey: That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over,then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandlerand Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measurepants?
Joey: What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God.
Joey: Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
Joey: I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
Joey: (joins him) I gotta get one, too.
Joey: Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Joey: Uh, does it hurt?
Joey: Chandler?
Joey: Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one getbigger?
Joey: Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What aboutRachel?

Joey: (to a guy) Bijan for men? (to a guy) Bijan for men? (To a woman) Bijanfor... (Sees it's a woman and stops.) (To Annabelle who walks up.) Hey, Annabelle, Uh,listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Joey: (To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboyspraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer ignores him, andJoey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?! 
Joey: What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)
Joey: Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
Joey: Exactly.
Joey: (sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box ajuice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Joey: Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more peopleon it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goesthrough two bottles a day.
Joey: I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downsthe glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game.They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Joey: Yeah I guess you're right.
Joey: I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)
Joey: Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'.
Joey: Yeah, I'm ready.
Joey: These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
Joey: I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.

Joey: Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking,that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Joey: (entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breakingup. He didn't blink or anything.
Joey: Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Joey: There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? Allright who's first? Huh? Ross?
Joey: Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?

Joey: Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always gotogether, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Joey: No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandlerfollows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from theGreek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?
Joey: Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Joey: Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive younuts before too, remember?
Joey: Look, what do you want me to say?
Joey: I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she startslaughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can havesomething to throw at her. 
Joey: Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?(Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')
Joey: I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
Joey: And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
Joey: But what does that gonna do...
Joey: Okay. I'm in.
Joey: Does it have to be a whole day?
Joey: Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, Ilove this woman. You have got competition buddy.
Joey: I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Joey: But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole daytogether and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at SheaStadium.
Joey: No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which meansI get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Joey: Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran intoRoss.
Joey: Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Joey: Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Joey: All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. (takes aglass from the fridge.)
Joey: (drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) Yep, it's fat. I drankfat!

Joey: Glass of fat?
Joey: What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Joey: Am I in it?
Joey: Whoa!
Joey: What?
Joey: How is this your seat?
Joey: But then you left.
Joey: What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
Joey: Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to thebathroom). Soo...
Joey: All right! You can have the chair.
Joey: Oh my, would you look at that! (holds up crossed fingers)
Joey: I'm so sorry.
Joey: Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Joey: Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Joey: Wow, what a cool job. (in a machine voice) 'You have two new messages.''Please, pass the pie.'
Joey: Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Joey: Now she sounded breezy.
Joey: Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)
Joey: You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about thecushions.
Joey: That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Joey: (entering) Where's my underwear?!
Joey: Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Joey: It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Joey: Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Joey: Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)
Joey: Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything youown.
Joey: Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybeif I wasn't going commando...
Joey: Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, Idon't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)
Joey: Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.

Joey: What is this? Fruit?
Joey: Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam atour place?
Joey: This will just be my batch.
Joey: Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at themovies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Joey: (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Joey: (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe withcrumbs)

Joey: Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey,Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Joey: Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprisedthere's any of my boys left.
Joey: Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives'on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Joey: Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Where you going?
Joey: Sperm or regular?
Joey: So you're really doing this, huh?
Joey: Sounds nice.
Joey: No kiddin', hmm. 
Joey: No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
Joey: I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall,smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
Joey: It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a bigpool.
Joey: He's got the body for it.
Joey: You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet,so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
Joey: Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three greatkids.
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds goodtoo. 
Joey: Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stopshugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) forlike a day. (hugs her again).
Joey: I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit ofTribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest ofthe jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe ifthey met me in person.
Joey: (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?
Joey: You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
Joey: (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on thecounter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Joey: Can we please turn this off?
Joey: (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy.(starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up atthe audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. Howcould you not give me the message?!
Joey: How is it you?
Joey: Yep, that's my audition.
Joey: Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missedmy chance.
Joey: Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends,she only talks to agents.
Joey: What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Joey: Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and hetries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)
Joey: I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)
Joey: I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Joey: Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me.Go get me a sweater.
Joey: Hey, you know about that?!
Joey: Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understandit, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, itseems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fearof heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be themost committed guy there ever was.
Joey: Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel ofthe gun, pee into the wind!
Joey: Come on baby, come on!
Joey: Thank you so much.
Joey: You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there'sthis one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Joey: Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Joey: Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I loveyou.
Joey: Nooo, four.
Joey: (entering) G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Joey: Pheebs! There you are!
Joey: But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the hallway)
Joey: Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think Igot a shot at it.
Joey: It's okay, these things happen.
Joey: I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)
Joey: No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs,rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Joey: They actually said that?
Joey: No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. Youknow, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (ina very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent.
Joey: Okay, shoot.
Joey: I didn't get it?
Joey: Okay, what else?
Joey: Oh.
Joey: Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate thisPheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Joey: Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but atleast with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Joey: You do, thanks.
Joey: Wait a minute.
Joey: Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out ofbeing my agent.
Joey: (in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.
Joey: Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the nextstep.
Joey: No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its aone day job, max.
Joey: Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes.
Joey: Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Joey: Her what?
Joey: Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Joey: Its just a game Mon. (makes a Can-you-believe-her faceto the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?
Joey: Hey-hey!
Joey: I know.
Joey: Oh, Im sorry. Did I get ya?
Joey: Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
Joey: Well, you shouldve told me that before, Im not a mind reader.Hey, were out of beer. Im going to Monicas.
Joey: Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got thosedesigner tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Joey: Nothing. Its just old and dingy, thats all.
Joey: Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used tobe. (Monica gasps) Yeah.
Joey: Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comesright off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, inhis tight pants.)
Joey: (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch ofthis stuff is glued down. Itd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you shouldjust leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)
Joey: Eh! There you go.
Joey: (yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of thosetiles.
Joey: Ooh, very official.
Joey: Why dont we just go on two.
Joey: Because its faster.
Joey: All right, but in the future...
Joey: So we are going on two?
Joey: Wow, its big!
Joey: Maybe, my rulers wrong.
Joey: Look its not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, alittle of my door.
Joey: Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Joey: Y'know what?
Joey: I bet ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)
Joey: Get out your checkbook, mister.
Joey: You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Joey: Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr.Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinksare on me!
Joey: Well, thats really a different question.
Joey: Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Joey: Okay, but lets say there was. How might that go?
Joey: Hey, theres a dog out there!
Joey: Dont you ah, dont you wanna ask me any questions?
Joey: Well, ah, Im an actor. Im fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV.Oh, and dont worry Im totally okay with the gay thing.
Joey: Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. Im totally coolwith that.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Hey! (goes into the apartment)
Joey: Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I dont!
Joey: Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Joey: Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.
Joey: Like you wouldnt believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This isa great place.
Joey: Gotcha.
Joey: Oh, you bet I am!
Joey: You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Joey: Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Joey: Oh right, right.
Joey: Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. Im such a jerk.
Joey: Baywatch.
Joey: Lifeguards.
Joey: Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Joey: They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Joey: No, no, no, dont get up, I got a cooler right here.
Joey: Cool!!
Joey: Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of yourneighbourhood?
Joey: Booo!!
Joey: (entering) Hey, you guys!
Joey: Guess what?
Joey: I got a gig!
Joey: Well, its not a part, no. Im teaching acting for soap operasdown at the Learning Extension.
Joey: Yeah, yeah. Its like my chance to give something back to the actingcommunity.
Joey: (glares at him) I know!
Joey: Good evening. Im Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting forsoap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of OurLives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one ofthe most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean actingagain, it means, you dont have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes likethis. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks,thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you willhave to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
Joey: Hi!
Joey: Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, Hey, the belldoesnt dismiss you, I dismiss you.
Joey: Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Joey: Yeah, its this great part, this boxer named Nick. And Im so,so right for it, y'know, hes just like me. Except hes a boxer, and has an eviltwin.
Joey: Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Joey: You want me to lie to Chandler?
Joey: No.
Joey: Hey, youre ah, pretty good at this.
Joey: Ahh!
Joey: Hey now!
Joey: Hey!!! Oww!! And Im bleeding.
Joey: Okay, great.
Joey: Okay.
Joey: All right. I cant see.
Joey: Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, Ive never been able to cry asan actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take apair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey thatIve just done something evil. That would be the basic I have a fishhook in myeyebrow and I like it (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretendfishhook.) Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is tryand divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And thats how its done. Great soapopera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Joey: Hey-hey.
Joey: Awww, one of my students got an audition. Im so proud.
Joey: You bet! Whats the part?
Joey: Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?
Joey: Whoa. That was really good.
Joey: Well, I-I mightve said supergay.
Joey: Because, Monica, the guys so good, and I really, really want thispart.
Joey: (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when youllhave a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in therecent, present. And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor toplay a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turnedout, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, hes got a twoyear contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, meIm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be onTV. Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause fromhis students.) Thank you.
Joey: All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Joey: Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)
Joey: (entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Joey: Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, tonot.
Joey: Itll kill him. I mean itll, itll just kill him.
Joey: (looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock.Its like a Play-Doo Fat Factory. 
Joey: What did they do?
Joey: Hey-hey, Ross?
Joey: Ive got a science question.
Joey: If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact Homo-sapien, is that whythere extinct?
Joey: Hey-hey, Im not judging.
Joey: Id really prefer a mountain bike.
Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her somethingspeacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
Joey: Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should gether one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Joey: (stopping him) No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, youcant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, youcant.
Joey: Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, thething is...
Joey: Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I sawJanice, kissing her ex-husband.
Joey: They were in his office.
Joey: Im telling you man, I saw it.
Joey: Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enemadoesnt sound so bad now, huh?
Joey: You said number two.
Joey: I know. (giggles harder)
Joey: Uh.
Joey: Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)
Joey: Im tellin ya, he hasnt moved since this morning.
Joey: Well, there is one way. His windows open, I say, we poke him.
Joey: Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get whenwe get Chinese food?
Joey: Well, now we got a reason.
Joey: Well, were fashioning a very long poking device.
Joey: Hey uh, whats a matter?
Joey: Oh my God, is she going back to him?
Joey: What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Joey: Well, it doesnt matter what I would do.
Joey: All right, youre probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if itwas me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, Iwould bow out.
Joey: They have a kid together, y'know. Theyre like, theyre like afamily, and if, I dont know, theres chance they could make that work, I know Iwouldnt want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wannaah, come poke a nude guy?
Joey: All right now remember, something this big and long is going to bedifficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Joey: All right, ladies and gentlemen, lets poke. (they start to advancethe giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.Okay, okay, were approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to theirview of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread theneedle. 
Joey: Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
Joey: Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
Joey: Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a littlethree on three going?
Joey: Great, you can cover Chandler.
Joey: Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Joey: Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, youget some fresh air, maybe itll take your mind off Janice, and if you dontplay, everyone will be mad at you cause the teams wont be even. Come on.
Joey: Says who? Your mom?
Joey: All right, we have to pick captains.
Rachel, Chandler, and Joey: What?
Joey: Thank you.
Joey: (to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here.

Monica and Joey: One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Joey: Set....hike!
Joey: Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
Joey: Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
Joey: Hi-hi, Im Joey.
Joey: Im sorry Dutch, I didnt get that last little bit.
Joey: Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
Joey: Mar-klan.
Chandler and Joey: Yeah! Why dont you stick around. You can sit rightthere.
Joey: I think so.
Joey: Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for itmyself, y'know.
Joey: Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, Ill let you haveher.
Joey: Well I dont like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Dont feel badman, we all have our strengths. Youre better with numbers and stuff.
Joey: Fumble!
Joey: What the hells the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Joey: All right, thats it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. Butnow, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Joey: Pheebs, run!
Joey: After!!
Joey: Its hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
Joey: What are you gonna do?
Joey: Okay.
Joey: Here you go!
Joey: Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that its better if wereon the same team.
Joey: Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Joey: Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place wherePeter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Joey: Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-Im not playing with this guy, now.
Chandler and Joey: What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? 
Joey: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didnt understand thequestion.
Joey: Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Joey: This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Joey: (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Joey: When theyre hungry enough, theyll come in.
Joey: And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Joey: What? Me having a job?
Joey: Well, Im pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey,Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, theirfulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Joey: Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Joey: Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Joey: Sure.
Joey: All right.

Joey: Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Joey: Well, they go into the chipper.
Joey: (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the cutit motion with his hands)
Joey: All right, Ill take a box of the cream filled Jesuss.
Joey: Look Rach, wasnt this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought youwanted to do fashion stuff?
Joey: If you ask me, as long as you got this job, youve got nothingpushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
Joey: (entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!
Joey: What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Joey: Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they havean opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
Joey: Not a problem.
Joey: And now for the great news.

Joey: Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorizeit. Show to everybody. Got it?
Joey: All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at thecard before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks alittle while) 5 of hearts.
Joey: I cant tell you that, no.
Joey: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wannaknow how I did it, Ill show ya. When you handed me back the card, what youdidnt see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picksup a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again.Here, Ill slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slowmotion)
Joey: Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we brokeup. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killedme.
Joey: Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Joey: I dont know, Chandler is supposed to be passin emaround...
Joey: Chandler!
Joey: Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Joey: No, only for sex.
Joey: Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Joey: (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!
Joey: Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)
Joey: I just got off the phone with my sister.
Joey: Mary-Angela.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Why dont you ask Chandler, cause hes the one that fooledaround with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is thattrue? Or are you just gettin over Janice by groping my sister. 
Joey: Really? Thats great! You and my sister, sittin in a tree.
Joey: Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Joey: You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look,listen, listen, you got to be cool, cause my Grandma doesnt know about you twoyet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit onMussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Joey: Shes right in there. (motions to the living room)
Joey: Whats goin on?
Joey: What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
Joey: Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought youdbe on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Joey: No! No! No! No, Im not going to punch Chandler.
Joey: No you wont. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believehim, hes sorry. But, (to Chandler) youve got one more apology to make, allright, youve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Joey: All right.
Joey: Cookie, now you can punch him!
Joey: All right, thats it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guyis going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel)But, is he a big guy?
Joey: (hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadwaymusical? 
Joey: It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I thinkI'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Joey: What? 
Joey: Who? 
Joey: The what? 
Joey: Oh, okay. (to Ross) The what? 
Joey: (singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks ahandkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two.......... 
Joey: Really? Thanks. 
Joey: Excellent, I'll be there. 
Joey: Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part. 
Joey: Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kidseither. 
Joey: Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly) 
Joey: Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing. 
Joey: Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. 
Joey: Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be? 
Joey: (reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty... 
Joey: Whoa, I'm not done. 
Joey: Done. 
Joey: Mark's a genius! 
Joey: And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' Andhe'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll belike, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' Andwe'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' 
Joey: So, does that mean the audition is off? 
Joey: What?! 
Joey: It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands. 
Joey: Bye. (does the jazz hands) 
Joey: I know, it was the best I could get out of them. 
Joey: People, people, people. 
Joey: (to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
Joey: Cool.
Joey: Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know youll probably behungry after the sex.
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Check the freezer. If theres none in there, then were probablyout. Are you just getting in from work? Its late.
Joey: I discovered Im able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Joey: Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
Joey: Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining,without making sure weve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
Joey: Havent you ever read the same book over and over again?
Joey: The question should be Rach, what is not so great about TheShining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariestbook ever. I bet its way better than that classic of yours.
Joey: All right, you got it.
Joey: Okay.
Joey: Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Joey: How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
Joey: These little women. Wow!
Joey: Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jos manuscript. I dont see how hecould ever forgive her.
Joey: But Jos got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You meanits like a girl-girl thing? Cause that is the one thing missing from TheShining.
Joey: No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Joey: (noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to hisside of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory)Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, Im Joey, we havent met.
Joey: Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Joey: Hey! (starts to laugh.) Hows it going?
Joey: Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Joey: Oooh, the next parts the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
Joey: All right Ill talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when thekid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Joey: Oh, all blank, and no blank, makes blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no,no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second theyget away. Aww!
Joey: Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys thehotel, and kills the dad.
Joey: Beth, Beth dies?
Joey: Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Joey: Then why would you say that?!
Joey: Beth is really, really sick.
Joey: Jos there, but I dont think theres anything she coulddo.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: (nodding his head) Okay.
Joey: Wow! This girl is good.
Joey: (to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Joey: (to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?
Monica, Ross, and Joey: (joining in) Home is Home Star stew.
Joey: (to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Joey: Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh!(hides behind the coat rack.)
Joey: Phew, close one.
Joey: (entering) Hey.
Joey: Is ah, is Chandler around?
Joey: Oooh.
Joey: Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasnt something that sounded likeGinger, like ah, Gingeer?
Joey: Aww, man. Thats the girl I was hiding from. When she finds outhes my roommate, shes gonna tell him what I did.
Joey: What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I cant, I cant tell you that,its like the most awful, horrible thing Ive ever done my whole life.
Joey: All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had goneout a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dads cabin. Just me,her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romanticdinner....
Joey: I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front ofthe fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Joey: I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably shouldve told youabout Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Joey: I ran!!
Joey: (entering from his bedroom) Morning.
Joey: (to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin huh?
Joey: Listen, I ah, I know its a longshot. But, by any chance did she findthat funny?
Joey: Yeah. You okay?
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Where have you been?
Joey: (to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar ofolives?
Joey: Done.
Joey: So Pheebs whats this guy like?
Joey: Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with thebelly button ring again?
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: Uh, y'know what, were having second thoughts about our copyingneeds. And well need a little more time to think about it.

Joey: God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Joey: Dude, I dont know.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open youreyes. Y'know, because you dont want to be doing something and then look up and seesomething you dont want to be seeing.
Joey: Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...(clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?
Joey: Yeah, I guess, but whats like heads and whats tails?
Joey: So what are you gonna do?
Joey: Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Joey: Nothing, hes just really believes in that.
Joey: (Voice Over) Previously on Friends.
Joey: Yeah. We figured when we couldnt find you, youd gone home tomake up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Joey: Look, Ross look, Im on board about this totally honesty thing, I am,just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.
Joey: Yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild.
Joey: All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnt find outsome other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think aboutthe trail?
Joey: (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) Thetrail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!(slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!
Joey: Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men,thats all. I mean, come on, its just a little wax.
Joey: Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Joey: Dont answer that.
Joey: Awful! Horrible!
Joey: She was nothing compared to you.
Joey: Ewwwww!
Joey: Y'know what, I dont think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes toopen the door)
Joey: Why not?! (to Chandler) Im hungry.
Joey: Yeah, well be fine.
Joey: Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathicmessage to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.
Joey: You think I need a new walk?
Joey: Well y'know, Ive been walking the same way since high school.Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think Ineed a take notice walk.
Joey: Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a come onlook.) Yeah, okay.
Joey: Maybe she killed him?
Joey: (whispering) No, I really have to pee.
Joey: Can I see the comics?
Joey: Okay, may I see the comics?
Joey: Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
Joey: Well Ross was hangin out over at our place, Rachel comes over toborrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Joey: Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Joey: Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened,that she should of forgiven him by now.
Joey: I had the same dream!
Joey: Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Joey: Yeah, I mean its never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Joey: Rach, its, its ah, its not that we dont want to,really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?
Joey: (He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel,Chandler mouths Come on!) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, andwe set that night aside.
Joey: Oh yeah.

Joey: Uhhhh. (Hes not sure)
Joey: No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything inthere.
Joey: Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
Joey: He cut off his ear.
Joey: Im out.
Joey: Wow! Thats pretty nice. I thought he cut off his earcause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Joey: In the woods. No wait-wait, thats the joke answer.
Joey: Spocks birth control.

Joey: Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Joey: Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Joey: All right thats it, school is in session! (Exits and slams thedoor.)
Joey: Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now,youre gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call thelandlord.
Joey: Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Joey: I have actually not heard of that.
Joey: Why dont you tell me something I dont know! (He storms out,and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an Oops! have.)
Joey: Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends likethat and that hed better come up here and apologize. Ill see you later.(Starts to leave)
Joey: He said that he wasnt gonna apologize because you guys are livinghere illegally, so instead what hes gonna do is have you evictedIll seeyou later.
Joey: Well he made Rachel cry!
Joey: All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandlerand I until you get settled.
Joey: All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turnsaround) I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell becool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)
Joey: Please dont kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasnt therefault, it was mine.
Joey: No you cant do that, where would the chick and the duck live?

Joey: It's 4:30.
Joey: Okay, I see what's going on here.
Joey: Yeah! You don't like Kathy.

Joey: Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) Butthat's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Joey: Is she great or what?
Joey: (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?
Joey: Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had adeal.
Joey: I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, thenthe least you can do is pretend.
Joey: Well then, do it better!
Joey: Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Joey: (opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart boardover the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actuallygonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?

Joey: Oh, I know... 
Joey: (entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. 
Joey: It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh? 
Joey: Why not? 
Joey: Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over...."Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!" 
Joey: She didn't have a birthday while we were going out. 
Joey: (whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got anaudition. I can't shop anymore! I... 
Joey: Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?

Joey: Yeah. 
Joey: Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened? 
Joey: All right, so... next time, you take her to your place. 
Joey: What kind of smell?

Joey: Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now. 
Joey: Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this,because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this! 
Joey: Hey!

Joey: Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!

Joey: (opening bedroom door) Hey, that coupon expires, you know. 
Joey: Great! All right, so Ill call you later.
Joey: That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
Joey: No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with hertonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Joey: Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza bymyself! (Laughs)
Joey: Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Joey: What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
Joey: You got all that from the back of her head?
Joey: Whos Elaine?
Joey: (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, its me. Listen Casey and Iwere on our way back and had a little car trouble.
Joey: We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get sometransmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that Ill be there assoon as I can.

Joey: Yeah?
Joey: Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more(his time runs out forreal)
Joey: (on phone) Hey dude, its me.
Joey: Listen uh, Im really sorry, it looks like Im gonna be stuckhere for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, thetransmission wasnt there!
Joey: Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hita dog.
Joey: Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Joey: Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on thedoor.)
Joey: (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Joey: Why?
Joey: Well, youre amazing.
Joey: (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream!Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Joey: Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Joey: Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and heylisten, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Imgonna do that.
Joey: No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shespretty cool.
Joey: No-no, Kathy.
Joey: No. No, Kathy.
Joey: Yknow what I think? I think somebodys got a little crush onCasey. How bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Joey: Hey! Samboucha Margarita? 
Joey: Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Joey: Whats up?
Joey: You do?
Joey: Well, youre timing couldnt be better. Shes not mygirlfriend anymore.
Joey: Yeah, she broke up with me.
Joey: Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kindof scene, thats why I let people watch.
Joey: Well, Ive been better. But, Im all right. So you like her huh?
Joey: No-no-no, no its uh, its okay.
Joey: Yeah. You know why? Cause you came to me first.
Joey: But hey, listen just so you know, you might have youre work cut outfor you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that shes intosome other guy. So
Joey: Who?
Joey: What?
Joey: And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Joey: What?!! Thats even worse!!
Joey: I dont know! But its the same!
Joey: Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Joey: Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line, thatyou-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Joey: Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like"Well, kinda.") Well, yknow what I will not watch your TV, I will notlisten to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker thatIm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Joey: Because its all tainted with your betrayal. From now on thisapartment is empty for me! And Im not happy about you either. (The bread makerdings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroomand slams the door.)
Joey: (answering phone) Hello.
Joey: (answering phone) Hello.
Joey: (answering phone) Stop callin!!
Joey: All right!
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Joey: No! Im putting that in my room.
Joey: Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, wouldyou hear him out?
Joey: Five years. 
Joey: Hey! Dont do the crime if you cant do the time.
Joey: No, was my best friend. Anyway, I dont know whyyoure pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend,theres a spot open.
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: What?
Joey: All right. But if you werent my best friend.
Joey: (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Joey: (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)
Joey: My folks.
Joey: I dont know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for anapartment.
Joey: Yeah, yknow at first I thought we could talk about this yknow,work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I dont think I
Joey: Look, its not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together justreminds me of what you did. And I dont want to live with some one who doesntknow what it is to be a friend. So, Ill see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandlergrabs his bag and stops him.)
Joey: Yeah! You did! And thats why Im leaving.
Joey: When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unitfor like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking abouthow I let you down! 
Joey: Yeah! But if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turnout to be, I wouldnt have worried about it so much! See you around!
Joey: Weve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)
Joey: (coming out of the bathroom) Whats twisted?
Joey: Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Joey: Hes fine!
Joey: Chandler?
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Hes doin some thinkin!
Joey: You kissed my girlfriend!
Joey: That doesnt sound like thinking to me!
Joey: Yknow I dont think you should be talking at all in there! Ithink youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Joey: All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it,all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnt mean anything to you, thenyou should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box!
Joey: So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Joey: That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?(Theres no response from Chandler.) Okay.
Joey: Ill get it. (Its Kathy.)
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Thats okay. Chandlers the one Im mad at.
Joey: In the box.
Joey: (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)
Joey: He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Getout of there!
Joey: Yeah, were gonna be fine! Get out!
Joey: Yeah, you did some real good thinkin in there.
Joey: Now go! Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas fromyoure secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.) 
Joey: All right, who got Chandler? Cause I uh, need to trade.
Joey: Uhh, thats not them. Im gonna go call the police.
Joey: I think I know that girl.
Joey: Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Joey: Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun withme, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Joey: Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
Joey: No, I had sex in high school.
Joey: Will you calm down, hes just a human guy.
Joey: Really?!
Joey: All right, Ill see you guys.
Joey: I have an audition, but Ill definitely hook up with you later. Whereare you gonna be around noon?
Joey: Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)
Joey: Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought youd be out partyingwith Gandel-worf.
Joey: So youve been sittin around here all mornin?
Joey: So what if he didnt come! We can still go out and party ourselves!

Joey: All right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, andwell head back out.
Joey: So, were having fun, right?
Joey: We dont need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked tosome strangers, and uh, after this, well head down to the docks and see about thatboat thing.
Joey: Are you serious?!
Joey: Thank God! Im exhausted!
Joey: Yeah, but uh, I dont want to be up too late, so uh, Ill have adecaf. 
Joey: I cant hear a word youre saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Joey: Yeah, I know.

Joey: Were 29, were not women.
Joey: Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now? (He smiles and has cookieremains all over his teeth.)
Joey: Well, I know what Im giving you for Christmas.
Joey: Ohhh!
Joey: Hey, Mon! Im not doing anything, why dont you fire me?
Joey: Good enough to get fired.
Joey: Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guydirect Burger King commercials?
Monica, Rachel, and Joey: Yes!
Joey: What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail.Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Joey: Sure! Where are the seats?
Joey: Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
Joey: Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
Joey: Oh, what are you gonna do? Youre gonna fire me?
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Joey: (checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)
Joey: (entering from the dining room) Hey.
Joey: Hey, what happened to your fancy chefs jacket? (sees theres aburn spot on it)
Joey: You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happensto be over her breast.)
Joey: Its still a tiny bit on fire there.
Joey: Yeah. Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey. SinceI dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool worknickname.
Joey: (opening an envelope) Theres like-theres like 300 bucks inthis one!
Joey: No maam.
Joey: I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing therewith 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking,"Wow! Its been a long time since I had (tries to do the math in his head,but cant) 327 + 238 dollars!"
Joey: And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You dont fire me,instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and theyll start listening to all the nicethings Ive been saying about you.
Joey: Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Joey: (interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Yknow that little speech you madethe other day? Well I got a problem with it!
Joey: You bet I do! I just ah, wasnt listening then, thats all.
Joey: What are you gonna do? Youre gonna fire me?
Joey: Well I guess I shouldve thought about my wife and kids before Italked back to chef Geller!
Joey: Yep! Looks like its gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragonhouse this year.
Joey: (leaving) Lean-lean-lean!
Joey: (entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (Heswearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got.
Joey: Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Joey: No, not really. They give you all the information, its uh, itslike memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) "And on your left, you haveTyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Joey: Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Joey: Youre really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Joey: Huh.
Joey: No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportivelike crazy.

Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone waveHi to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard atwork.

Joey: Uhh, do you mind sitting there. Im-Im saving this for myfriend Ross.
Joey: Doctor? Wow! I didnt know he had a nickname.
Joey: Well, how-how come?

Anyway,look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross isone of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he will sitin it! (Ross enters and goes over to the white table) Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-Isaved you seat.
Joey: Its no big deal. Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Joey: Whatever.
Joey: Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal. Yknow you wear awhite coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then sobe it. Yknow, hey I understand. Yknow? Hey, when Im in a play andyoure in the audience, I dont talk to you, right? So its yknow,its uh, its cool. Ill see you tomorrow. (Leaves)
Joey: (standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his tableand they shake hands.)
Joey: (stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) Im Joey! Im anactor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!

Joey: Animals dressed as humans.
Joey: (to Chandler) The Irish gig guy?!
Joey: Its All Relative.
Joey: (to Chandler) Nana?
Joey: (answering the question) Althea!
Joey: I took a shot.
Joey: Hey, no way, that roosters family!
Joey: What do you have against the duck?! He doesnt make any noise!
Joey: Look, we are not gonna
Joey: (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
Joey: Oooooh!
Joey: Okay.
Joey: Big fat goalie.
Joey: Weekend at Bernies.
Joey: Everyday use.
Joey: Guest.
Joey: Uhh, 11!
Chandler and Joey: YEAH!!! YES!!!
Joey: I call Monicas room!
Joey: Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, Im sight of the room and Icalled it.
Joey: What?
Joey: Heyooh Pheebs, are they in there?
Joey: Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Joey: What?!
Joey: You cant just ignore the bet! Its a bet! You bet and you betand if you lose, you lose the bet!
Joey: Hey, dont get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Joey: But it is our apartment!
Joey: Did you see the size of the closets?!
Chandler and Joey: Awwwww!! (They lean back all the way.) Awwwwwww!!!
Joey: (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)
Joey: (Holding a turkey leg) Theres gravy?
Joey: I think I left a donut up here.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.
Joey: Chandler, look theyre actors. Theyre there to do a job, justcause they work together, doesnt mean theyre gonna get together. I meanjust cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesnt meanits gonna happen with them.
Joey: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. 
Joey: Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it onstage, was it like really hot?
Joey: Well okay, so then youre fine. The rule is when two actors areactually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as longas its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. Its when the heat goesaway, thats when youre in trouble.
Joey: Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I everhad chemistry on stage?
Joey: Noooo!!
Joey: Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Joey: Yep! Grab a plate.
Joey: No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, whichflies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin closer.
Joey: Listen also were uh, were watching the game here Saturdaynight, if people want to come over.
Joey: Oh yeah, whos playing?
Joey: All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Joey: I dont know, it smells good.
Joey: (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!
Joey: Come here.
Joey: Oh, yeah, totally! Thats such a turn-on!
Joey: Oh-ooh, thats the turn-on.
Joey: Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,"Hey, how you doin?"
Joey: (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin?
Joey: Well, you gotta give him something that he cant say no too. Like uh,Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, youre guaranteed hell sayyes!
Joey: Absolutely! And if it doesnt, can I get the extra ticket?
Joey: What the heck is that?
Joey: No! Forget her, man! You dont need her, you dont need that!
Joey: Dude, tell me she actually told you this.

What are you doing with your life?"
Joey: Look, theres nothing I can do for him right now, hes still inhis sweat pants, thats still Phase One. Y'know? Ill be back for Phase Two, Iwould never miss Phase Two.

Joey: Yknow, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know whoI think it is?
Joey: No-no, its uh, its Heston.
Joey: Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip andthen ate some liquorice.

Joey: No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, Im an actor, Joey Tribbiani,Im doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.

Joey: Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy(Points). And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!
Joey: Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you lookbigger to you from where you are.
Joey: I totally dont know what youre talking about.
Joey: No.
Joey: Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!
Joey: The Red Ross! Okay.

Joey: Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
Joey: All right look, yknow how-yknow how when youre datingsomeone and you dont want to cheat on them, unless its with someone reallyhot?
Joey: All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If youre goingto do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!
Joey: Feel better now?
Joey: Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Joey: Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Joey: Well, suppose until the babys born I laid off it. No extra animalswould die, you-youd just be eating my animals.
Joey: Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. Theres no meat in beer, right?
Joey: Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)
Joey: (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.
Joey: Oooh, what you got there?
Joey: Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Yknow what goes good with that?
Joey: Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but thats much better. How about alittle of that smoked turkey?

Joey: Dude, I screwed up, you dont have to turn me in!
Joey: Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said theyre gonna look intoit right after they solved all the murders.
Joey: I did that too! They wouldnt give me her real name or her number.They said, "If I bothered them again theyd call the police." I said,"If you talk to the police, you tell them Im missing a ring!"
Joey: Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I
Joey: Oh, that sounds like fun, but weve got a ring to find!!
Joey: All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why wouldshe? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Illbe uh, Mr. Wong.
Joey: There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
Joey: I dont get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didnttake it, and I didnt take it; and you (Chandler) didnt take it, then who did?(The duck quacks.) Shh! Were trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at thesame moment and stare at Joey, who doesnt get it. After a short pause, with the duckstill quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)
Joey: If anything should happen to him
Joey: So! Things can go wrong! You dont know! What if he doesnt makeit?!
Joey: Yeah, but what if he doesnt? Hes such a good duck.
Joey: Im so worried about him, yknow?
Joey: H-h-h-hows the duck?
Joey: Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Joey: No, its not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally letyou down!
Joey: Yeah, it is! You wouldnt have lost the ring, right? Yknowwhat, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.
Joey: Now, dont argue with me
Joey: Really?
Joey: (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away sothat they cant see him cry.)
Joey: Its all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less thanenthused Chandler and starts towards the girls apartment.)

Joey: My Giant? I love that movie!
Joey: Can I ask you something?
Joey: Felicity and I, were watching My Giant, and I was thinking,"Im never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think Imjust wasting my life with this acting thing?
Joey: I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, yknow, youthink Ill ever get there?
Joey: Thanks man. 
Joey: But what about how much taller he is than me?
Joey: I mean, theres no way I can make myself taller now, yknow? Andwho knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die anunsuccessful, regular sized man?
Joey: Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.

Joey: That was good beer.
Joey: Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those badboys.
Joey: Later! (Exits.)
Joey: (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.
Joey: Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)
Joey: Hey, Pheebs!
Joey: (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!
Joey: (Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?
Joey: I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Joey: (In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.
Joey: Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Joey: Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get togo to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Joey: All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should alltake a little trip together!
Joey: Yeah, all of us! All day!
Joey: Phoebe!

Joey: Oh! (In an announcer type voice) And so the miracle of life begins, andaaiiyyyeeee! (He grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)
Joey: Ooh, something hurts!
Joey: Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Joey: Oh my!
Joey: Not in my head.
Joey: (in a sexy voice) Yep! There's always room for Jell-O
Joey: Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, (snaps hisfingers and in a sexy voice) Grandma's chicken salad
Joey: (entering) Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the USAToday and hands Ross the camera.) Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day youwere born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies (Throws the paper away toreveal a copy of Playpen, which is the TV version of Playboy Magazine.) Check itout, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, nowlet's dive right into the good stuff. (Joey opens the magazine and Ross sticks the camerain it.)
Joey: Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Joey: Yeah, I was bummed too.
Joey: I think Saturday(groans in pain again).
Joey: (entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) Hey, you guys! Lookwhat I found in the giiiiiiift shop. (He doubles over in pain in front an old man in awheel chair.) Get up! Get up! Get up! (The old man waves him away.)
Joey: Umm, well, what else could it be?
Joey: Or?
Joey: Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Joey: (interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up,up is not an optionwhat's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Areyou crazy?!
Joey: Ohh, get these things out of me!
Joey: I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! (He starts rocking back andforth, taking Ross with him.)
Joey: Argh!
Joey: Argh!
Joey: Oh my God.
Joey: They're so small! (Both he and Ross look at them with satisfied looks ontheir faces.)
Joey: Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw usout!
Joey: (to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!
Joey: Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hopingthat someone will help him get in touch with her.
Joey: Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Joey: (entering, wearing a tux) Hey!
Joey: Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Joey: Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job asco-host!
Joey: A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's thekind of math Joey likes to do!
Joey: Why dont you like PBS, Pheebs?
Joey: I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed.Like-like you did with the babies.
Joey: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother?Talk about selfish!
Joey: Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feelreally good right?
Joey: It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's nounselfish good deeds, sorry.
Joey: Well, may I ask for one example?
Joey: That's because all people are selfish.
Joey: Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry toburst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal onSanta Clause right?
Joey: That he doesn't exist.
Joey: (To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
Joey: That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
Joey: But I'm the host!
Joey: You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Joey: (on phone) Hey Mon!
Joey: See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TVand that's good exposure. 
Joey: Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the womannext to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)
Joey: Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.)
Joey: (in a bored voice) PBS telethon.
Joey: What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Joey: Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Joey: Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Joey: Come on man! You've been here all day!
Joey: (in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon.
Joey: Hey Pheebs!
Joey: $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did toya?
Joey: And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Joey: A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Joey: Monica? What time is it?
Joey: But it's dark out.
Joey: I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into thebathroom.)
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Doesnt seem like it's going to work, I mean
Joey: Hi!
Joey: So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Joey: (holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and brokeup and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel atthe wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Joey: You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have torepopulate the Earth.
Joey: Hey, you're back!
Joey: How was your conference?
Joey: Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Joey: Hey, you're back too!
Joey: Hey, how was your chef thing?
Joey: (sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?
Joey: Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myselfwithout twenties and you always have lots!
Joey: You want my advice?
Joey: You're not gonna like it.
Joey: You got married to fast.
Joey: I told ya.
Joey: Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Joey: Hi, Rach.
Joey: I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is rightback there. (Points over his shoulder.)
Joey: Hey, you're not Kip!
Joey: Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?
Joey: Oh, that poor bastard.
Joey: Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left aneyelash curler in your room.
Joey: 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Joey: Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look,I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Wereyou, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Joey: (entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorryto interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
Joey: (shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Joey: Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Joey: Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Joey: (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
Joey: How?! When?!
Joey: IN LONDON!!!
Joey: But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
Joey: All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but
Joey: Aww, I don't want to see that!
Joey: I guess I'm done.
Joey: I think I'm gonna take-off.
Joey: (entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're livingunder my roof!
Joey: Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I likelooking at it.
Joey: Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for hisroom.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if Ihave to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there'snothing to know about.
Joey: (from the bedroom) I can hear that!
Joey: I can still hear you!
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Joey: Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Joey: (after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross'sfurniture has got Rachel coodies?
Joey: No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross seeRachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Joey: No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Joey: I'll take it!
Joey: Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right,what do you think?
Joey: What's the matter Ross?
Joey: That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.)Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Joey: Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches himagain.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Joey: Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Joey: Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Joey: Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like thisfour-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella. 
Joey: Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close offthe kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Joey: Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Joey: You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Areyou, are you crazy?!
Joey: It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang entersbehind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guyssaid I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just toldme that he's not entirely happy.
Joey: We all hate Emily!
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Joey: I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Joey: Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was boundto slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)
Joey: Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuffand I just acted like a jerk.
Joey: Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Joey: Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
Joey: Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotionsright at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makeslike he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wanderaround, you're alone
Joey: (thinks) I'm not sure.
Joey: RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Joey: All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor
Joey: It's almost as if he knew.
Joey: Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn surewho's not here and that's Rachel!!
Joey: I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Joey: You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns hisback to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The cameracuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joeyalternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads backinside.)
Joey: What happened? What happened?
Joey: No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)
Joey: I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Joey: Why?
Joey: Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Okay.
Joey: Ross?
Joey: Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while,why don'tI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Joey: Hey, all right!
Joey: (To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Nothing.
Joey: (smiles) Kinda.
Joey: Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Joey: Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don'tyou be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Joey: Sorry.
Joey: Ahhhhhhhhhh 
Joey: Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Joey: No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all theboxes. Come on!
Joey: All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?(Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flapshis hands as if he's waving good-bye.)
Joey: No, the quiet down thing!
Joey: Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did youknow he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if thathad been porn?
Joey: All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Joey: YES!!
Joey: Um-hmm.
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Joey: You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chickenand it was closed!
Joey: Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, whereare we gonna eat?!
Joey: Umm, yum!
Joey: Mine! (He grabs it.)
Joey: Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!
Joey: But it's available now! Isn't it?
Joey: Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)
Joey: Okay!
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Joey: But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Oh, it's perfect!
Joey: He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think wecould get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Joey: Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: I don't know. Maybe pizza?
Joey: Oh! Oh!
Joey: Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Rossput us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'llever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Joey: (getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step andfalls flat on his face.)
Joey: Hey!
Joey: You're kidding!
Joey: But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! 
Joey: Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Pointsto where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards hisdoor.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
Joey: Definitely!
Joey: All right!
Joey: Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Joey: I need something sweet.
Joey: Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Joey: Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze camein out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm alsothankful for thongs. (Note: Actually, I think every guy is thankful for thongs.That and spandex. J )
Joey: I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. Imean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they playwith your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Joey: Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandlerbumming us out!
Joey: Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any pastlife memories.
Joey: Hey, it's not like it sounds.
Joey: (muffled) Hello?
Joey: Phoebe?
Joey: Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)
Joey: I know! It's stuck!!!
Joey: I put it on to scare Chandler!
Joey: Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Joey: It's Joey.
Joey: I can't! It-it's stuck!
Joey: Sorry! Sorry.
Joey: (pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Joey: (turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are!(Starts dancing.) I scared you!
Joey: Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Rememberwhen Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternutbuash?"
Joey: You're a dork.
Joey: Yeah, they're mine.
Joey: I don't know uhh (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I'm Joey.Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
Joey: (reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.
Joey: That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop!(Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler'sroom.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Joey: Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keepembarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and Ididn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in aplay. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up hispants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)
Joey: Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't
Joey: Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Joey: All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.
Joey: Didn't think so.
Joey: Hey, Pheebs!
Joey: What's wrong buddy?
Joey: I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Joey: So you uh, still wondering?
Joey: You're smart. I like that.
Joey: Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
Joey: Hiya.
Joey: I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Pointsat Chandler, angrily.)
Joey: You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The goodJoey name is being dragged through the mud here!
Joey: Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain theunderwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Joey: Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found myunderwear at your place?
Joey: Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Joey: All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Startsfor his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
Joey: Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Joey: No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just I justKinda
Joey: Thank you!
Joey: What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleadingwith Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!
Joey: No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Joey: No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Joey: (thinking) I slept with Monica.
Joey: Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Joey: Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that'sbeen going on?
Joey: Ahhoy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.Right Monica?
Joey: No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has beentrying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
Joey: That makes sense!
Joey: Uhh, Monica?
Joey: But sadly I could not be enticed.
Joey: Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who'snot. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, sothe chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)
Joey: What are you doing?
Joey: Why are you doing this?
Joey: Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. Youve got tospread it out a little, you know. Havent you ever been unemployed?
Joey: Hey, dont get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a littleconfused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Whydo you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come heresit down. (Ross sitsdown.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh,yeah!! Huh?!
Joey: Ohh, no, no. Were not going to just sit. (Joey sits down andhits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)
Joey: (In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Joey: But, I love you.
Joey: And thats Wednesday. (He reclines in his chair.) Ohh.
Joey: So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Joey: How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italianactor from Queens.
Joey: Shes a woman!
Joey: (Very discouraged) Okay, is there anything else?
Joey: That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Joey: Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are thechances I could get those guys to star in it?
Joey: Wait a second, I could star in it!
Joey: I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the disciplinethat takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Joey: Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Joey: Thanks!
Joey: Done!
Joey: It's not.
Joey: (disappointed) Oh.
Joey: Hey, how do you spell suspicious? 
Joey: Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Joey: You're driving me crazy with that!
Joey: Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Joey: Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Joey: Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I haveto write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Joey: (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up anotch?
Joey: All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. 
Joey: Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Joey: Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to thedoor.)
Joey: Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Joey: You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: (To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.
Joey: Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Joey: Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have neverplayed.
Joey: Come on look guys, don't fight.
Joey: Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game ofFireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Joey: Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Joey: Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that reallypretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
Joey: Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
Joey: They're brother and sister!!!
Joey: (entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I alreadyfinished my five pages for today!
Joey: No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Joey: Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it.And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. Sowould you guys read it for me?
Joey: Okay. (Reading.) "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guysare hanging out." Ross (Points to him.)
Joey: Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
Joey: A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How'sit going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks toboth of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) wellyou co-created Fireball. The end.
Joey: No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming upwith new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!
Joey: (Reading the scene set up.) Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment.Two girls are just hanging out.
Joey: What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Joey: All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Joey: What's the matter?!
Joey: All right, I'll take care of it.
Joey: Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel orPhoebe?

Joey: So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: So did that do anything for ya?
Joey: All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Joey: Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would loveit would be great if one of those was true.
Joey: Really? Who-who have you taught?
Joey: Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Chandler and Joey: Hey!
Joey: Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
Joey: You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Joey: Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keepquiet as Phoebe enters.)
Joey: See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson. 
Joey: Umm, okay.
Joey: Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe'schords.)
Joey: Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today Istopped by this guitar store and
Joey: No.
Joey: Yes!
Joey: Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)
Joey: You look like a freak.
Joey: Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monicastarts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with theexcessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)
Joey: Yes! Yes, I did.
Joey: (thinks) (quietly) G-sharp.
Joey: What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Joey: No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monicastanding between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)
Joey: Your other student, was you!

Joey: (answering phone) Hello?
Joey: Uhh, Chandler's not here.
Joey: Okay.
Joey: Nice!
Joey: Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Joey: Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some ofthe moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Joey: Umm, do you see anyoh, Vaseline? 
Joey: Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Joey: Ross? You okay?
Joey: Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Joey: Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourselfa pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Joey: (To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it worksout. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)
Joey: Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all overthe place.
Joey: What-what is it, what is it?
Joey: Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Joey: I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all thesecrets but can't tell anyone!
Joey: And you're not supposed to be gossiping!! 
Joey: I'm not listening to you!
Joey: Hey, Pheebs?
Joey: Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your methodwas stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't toucha guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) Youreally think I'm ready?
Joey: Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note.However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the tableand lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)
Joey: (sitting back down) Was the chord at least right
Joey: Howdy partner!
Joey: Umm?
Joey: Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pullinghis fingers out of his ears.)
Joey: Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah.Yeah!
Joey: Now? You want me to go over there now?
Joey: Do you know something?
Joey: I might know something.
Joey: What's the thing you know?
Joey: I can't tell you what I know.
Joey: Okay, fine.
Joey: You don't know!
Joey: (gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!
Joey: Yeah, I know!!!!
Joey: Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about thisfor so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weirdabout that! Listen (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)
Joey: Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Joey: Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal,so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Joey: Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Joey: (thinks) I don't know.
Joey: I don't know.
Joey: (thinks) I don't know.
Joey: Ohh, I know one thing!
Joey: They did it right there on the couch. 
Joey: Hey Ross!
Joey: (eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?
Joey: (entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Joey: Really?
Joey: Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail andstuff.
Joey: All right, let's go Pheebs.
Joey: Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Joey: That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Joey: (snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Joey: He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Joey: All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. Heobviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Joey: Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Joey: Damnit Phoebe!!
Joey: All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Joey: All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removesthe waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) Andthey're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
Joey: Judge rules, no violation.
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: What?!
Joey: And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Joey: Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: (entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Joey: Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Joey: Umm, hi.
Joey: Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Joey: Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up fromthe floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)
Joey: Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part ofthis real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure thateveryone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashionstuff.
Joey: Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Joey: Great! Thanks, Rach!
Joey: All right. 
Joey: Are you all right?
Joey: Pheebs! Sorry!
Joey: Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Joey: All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Joey: Really? A purse?
Joey: It looks like a women's purse.
Joey: See look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder andlooks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purselooks good on me, a man.
Joey: Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Joey: Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it justlooked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all yourstuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Joey: Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and startseating.)
Joey: Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Joey: Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cardsthat come with the bag.)
Joey: All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I amdefinitely gonna get thanks to you.
Joey: U-N-I-sexy? (Smiles provocatively.) 
Joey: Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Joey: Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)
Joey: (approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check itout. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me.(Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slaphim in his face.)
Joey: What did you say to him?
Joey: (entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Joey: Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? Andit's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn'tmake it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the factthat Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)
Joey: (reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get atable and I'll buy you a drink.
Joey: Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be newhere. Maybe we shouldI'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks aquestion.)
Joey: Well, first it's not a purse.
Joey: I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man'sbag!
Joey: All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's thelatest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Joey: Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Joey: Yeah but I didnt read anything.
Joey: Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting thebag.) We got it! We got it!
Joey: (dejected) Hi.
Joey: Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)
Joey: Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problemswith me.
Joey: Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with thebag!
Joey: Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Joey: I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?(She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Joey: I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Joey: Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can,we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Joey: (entering) Hey guys!
Joey: What? What?
Joey: You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)
Joey: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of usknow that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets wouldfinally be over!
Joey: No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Tellingthem.
Joey: I can't take any
Joey: Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets.I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Joey: Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joeyshies away.)
Joey: Ugh.
Joey: Yeah?
Joey: Well I didn't tell them!
Joey: Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Joey: And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Joey: I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them thatyou know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Joey: No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Joey: I'm listening.
Joey: So he likes to break stuff.
Joey: Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Joey: No.
Joey: They know you know.
Joey: I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Joey: (looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly NakedGuy has a naked friend!
Joey: (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in mychair!
Joey: Ooh!
Joey: I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
Joey: It's not my first time.
Joey: Dude!
Joey: All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Joey: (panicking) Dude! He's right there!
Joey: Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and letthese two lovebirds get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.)Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.

Joey: Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
Joey: (to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
Joey: So, are you ready to go?
Joey: Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)
Joey: I was thinking Chinese food.
Joey: I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but
Joey: (shyly) She keeps punching me.
Joey: Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she'shurting me.

Joey: Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I likeyou. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfullypunch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very realbat.

Joey: Hey! Hiya!
Joey: Huh.
Joey: Uhh.
Joey: Nah.
Joey: What a bad idea!
Joey: She's right y'know.
Joey: Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
Joey: Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Joey: That's not funny at all!
Joey: Hey!
Joey: What are you guys doing up?
Joey: (thinks) Dark red.
Joey: Aww, you guys are so cute!
Joey: All right, I'll see you in the morning.

Joey: Well, it involved Monica.

Joey: Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crosswordpuzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monicaand I'll be moving out.
Joey: It-it doesnt?
Joey: That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Joey: In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Joey: (looks at her) Not really.
Joey: No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? Imean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, buty'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Joey: Friends first? That's interesting.

Joey: Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talkingto Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Joey: Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'mthinking of getting me one of those.
Joey: Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great
Joey: is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself,"Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So
Joey: I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Joey: I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)
Joey: Won't-won't that take longer?
Joey: Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause) Man, I wish I saw Phoebefirst!
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)
Joey: Uhh, well, she'sreally good in bed.
Joey: (To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Joey: Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! Assoon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. Isuddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And herroommate!
Joey: Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Joey: (entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Joey: (taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?

Joey: That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can seeme! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before.
Joey: Nope. Op, wait! There he goes. 
Joey: (waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that awoman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.)(Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl inRoss's building is flirting with me.
Joey: Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, heregoes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Doesa little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. Shesmiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.)Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor
Joey: Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no,I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monicaaway and makes a disgusted face.)
Joey: This is your place?
Joey: But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)
Joey: Ugh!!
Joey: I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.(Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels onhis remote.)
Joey: Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fallright out of your chair?
Joey: What happened?
Joey: You kissed him?!
Joey: I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Joey: Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?
Joey: Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey.Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl'sback!
Joey: No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to thewindow.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.(He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)
Joey: Damnit!! Did you move?!
Joey: (Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Joey: Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door whichis answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, orbabysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Joey: Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a wholeother corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Joey: (entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'?(Has a silly grin.)
Joey: I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.)Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet heranyway.
Joey: Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like ofhot girl parallel universe, or something.
Joey: No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartmentfrom the left.
Joey: I did not know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can'tbelieve I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Joey: Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)
Joey: Okay, pick a card.
Joey: All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?
Joey: (holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)
Joey: (reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial castingdirector in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!(Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to goBen! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a milliontimes and no one offered me an audition.
Joey: I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
Joey: Luck!
Joey: Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Joey: Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Joey: Done.
Joey: They're gonna do it together.
Joey: What, so I gotta shut it down now?
Joey: Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Joey: Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get anaudition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Joey: What?! Are you kidding?!
Joey: All right!
Joey: Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Joey: I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actuallyseen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
Joey: Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like SugarSmacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good inthat one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad.
Joey: That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben'sdad?
Joey: I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)
Joey: (also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actuallydidn't get a callback.
Joey: (Happily) Yeah I did!
Joey: Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
Joey: Who knows?
Joey: Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Joey: Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Joey: Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!
Joey: Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Joey: Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know megoing up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, Ithink I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Joey: That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my careerwe're talking about here!
Joey: I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyoneshould step aside it should be Ben!
Joey: What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Joey: At least I care about his feelings!
Joey: Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesnt get it?
Joey: Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean hedials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Joey: You just give him a spoon baby!
Joey: Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Joey: Yeah?! So's yours!
Joey: Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.) Hmm soup! (Tries again, with a littlecaveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!
Joey: Oh yeah, no problem.
Joey: (goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya,it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. DrakeRemoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Joey: (angrily) Ross!
Joey: Hi!
Joey: Uh-oh.
Joey: Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that'sokay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
Joey: Oh, what did I say?

Joey: Hmm, noodle soup.
Joey: Okay.
Joey: Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
Joey: No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful)Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)
Joey: Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck.I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." (Nods his headin disgust.)
Joey: What you do mean?
Joey: Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
Joey: Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah.Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor
Joey: No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it wasmore important to see him succeed.
Joey: Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
Joey: Eh, what are you gonna do?
Joey: (entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! Youremember my grandmother!

Joey: Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the copson the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.
Joey: (smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother ifshe finds out.
Joey: (smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.
Joey: (smiling) Not likely.  'Cause you see that body bag right there
Joey: (smiling) I'm in it.
Joey: (smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. Whenthey dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
Joey: (smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They allsmile.)
Joey: Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, ofcourse it isn't him.)
Joey: No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
Joey: (To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I stillhaven't told her!
Joey: I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!
Joey: (dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runsout before anyone can stop him.)

Joey: Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Joey: Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have areal big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Joey: Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes rightin Joey's pocket.
Joey: Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for tenyears." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Joey: Hey!

Joey: See ya! (Walks out.)
Joey: Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Joey: Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quicklylooks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.
Joey: You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!
Joey: Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?

Joey: Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Joey: Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Joey: (shocked) What?!
Joey: Dude you said, "No!"
Joey: You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
Joey: I don't believe this!
Joey: What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Joey: Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping allover my big break.

Joey: Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Joey: Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! Theywould use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would getdirty so they would stick it right

Joey: Hey!

Joey: Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.)Hey Rach, how you doin'?

Joey: (sitting down) Ahhh! (Slides his hands across the table.)
Joey: No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway (Shakes hishands.)
Joey: (throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfoldit, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, lookingat it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho!(The dealer stares at him and he stops.)

Joey: Oh! Tell her shes not marriage material.

Joey: Yes.
Joey: That is incredible! You are the master!
Joey: What are you doing?
Joey: I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment)Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)
Joey: Im not finished.
Joey: (entering) Hey Monica!
Joey: (To Chandler) Hey man, you feeling any better? (Chandler answers himwith some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)

Joey: God, its gonna so weird like when I come home and youre nothere. Yknow? No more Joey and Chans. No more J and Cs. "You wannago over to Joey and Chandlers?" "Cant, its not there."
Joey: Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the nightand have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Joey: Hi.
Joey: Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! Its like the end of anera! No more J-man and Channies!! 
Joey: So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married,do you think you and I should hook up?
Joey: Really?! Well, when?
Joey: Wow.
Joey: Great!
Joey: Oh-oh, what about Ross?
Joey: (To Chandler) Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?!
Joey: Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, isshe cute?
Joey: Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin uh, Im gonna have an extra roomover at my place
Joey: Yeah, why dont you move in with me? Itll be great! We couldstay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursdays right?
Joey: Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.
Joey: I dont know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message."Jeez! (Exits.)
Joey: Hey, whats up?
Joey: But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came outtoday. (Shows him the paper.)
Joey: Yeah? I just figured yknow, after living with you itd be aninteresting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow? Someone I can learnfrom, someone-someone whos different than me. And whats more different thanme; a guy whos not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.)Not just a hat rack my friend!
Joey: (exiting from Chandlers room with the new roommate) Everything onyour application looks really goodOhh! Just one last question umm, are you and yourfriends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Joey: Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you toreally think about your answers. Okay?
Joey: Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants theapartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.
Joey: That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) Im very safetyconscious.
Joey: Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a goodidea?
Joey: Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before youknow it youre right where you dont want to be! Back together!
Joey: Thats not gonna work out! Then shes gonna come home all weepyand youll be tellin her, "Oh thats okay. Youll findsomeone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Joey: I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with youagain! Now, is that what you want?
Joey: Here she comes. Hold on, Im gonna make your life much easier.
Joey: Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)
Joey: No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, Iknow I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont haveto do that!
Joey: Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Joey: (opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!
Joey: Come in. Thanks for comin back, umm, okay there have been a lot ofpeople interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of thefinalists!
Joey: Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sureour personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, Im gonna say a wordand then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Joey: Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Joey: Very good! Okay. G.
Joey: Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
Joey: Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, butbye-bye! (He ushers herout the door.)
Joey: I cant believe she would say that too you.
Joey: (interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on thatpiece of paper?
Joey: Well, Ive just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paperthat didnt have naked chicks on it.
Joey: Oh-ooh-ooh! Yknow whats a good visual aide?
Joey: Why not?!
Joey: Hey! Any good mail?
Joey: Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me,Im kinda.
Joey: Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move calledbenefits lapsed.
Joey: Let me see that!
Joey: (reads it) Oh, I cant believe this! This sucks! When I had insuranceI could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? And it wouldnt matter. Now Igotta be careful?!
Joey: All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see myagent.
Joey: (mocks him, in a whiney voice) look both ways before you cross thestreet. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)
Joey: (entering) Hey Estelle, listen
Joey: What are you talkin about? I never left you! Youve always beenmy agent!
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
Joey: Why?
Joey: Bastard!
Joey: (in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for metomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time.
Joey: What?!
Joey: Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was liftingweights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. Butum, I dont think its anything serious.
Joey: No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anythingits gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and showsChandler.)
Joey: Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he wasusing.) Damn you 15s!
Joey: Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides itsgetting darker and more painful, that means its healing.
Joey: Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and Idont want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks inI can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, Im thinking Ill probably startwith that laser eye surgery too.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Look, Im telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (Heputs his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on MarriedWith Children alwaysused to do.) it doesnt hurt that bad.
Joey: Sure, now Im scared.
Joey: Yeah, but I dont wanna die!
Joey: (in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. "Hey, Timmy, Ive got asurprise for you."
Joey: Oh yeah, sure, no problem, Ill justhold on one second. (Heturns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.)"Hey Timmy, Ive got a surprise for you!"
Joey: So thats why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!(He turns, looks at the bag and realizes he wont be able to pick it up.)
Joey: Exactly.
Joey: Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One,point to a bag today. (She just looks at him.) I didnt get it, did I?
Joey: Yeah, okay. (Leaves)
Joey: Hi. Im Joey Tribbiani; Im here to audition for (Groans) man.
Joey: Yes!
Joey: (barely audible through the pain) Thank you.
Joey: Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping metake a shower.
Joey: (to the director) Hiya!
Joey: Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in mypants. (Holds them both up.)
Joey: "Take could care of your Momma son." (Alex just looks at him andthe director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) "Take could care ofyour Momma son." (Alex does nothing.) "Come on son! Your Mommas goodpeople!"
Joey: Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream rightup until you say action?
Joey: Okay. (Starts screaming.)
Joey: (he stops screaming at action) "Take good care of your Mommason." (Again Alex does nothing.)
Joey: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, dont holdback. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a woodenbaseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Joey: Hey-hey-hey!
Joey: Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. (Looks at them) Ooohh, to a Porsche!{Transcribers note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? IfI had a Porsche, Id have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther,these yours?
Joey: Na-uh! (To everyone there) Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Joey: Theres a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) Myshoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)
Joey: Well, I didnt realize until I got home. I wasnt gonna walk allthe way back down here with one shoe! Yknow what? Im gonna go find thatguys car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)

Joey: (entering) Hey guys!
Joey: Hey babies! Oh, Im having the best morning. That uh, that PorscheIve got the keys too, still there!
Joey: You should see the treatment I get when Im with that car! People arefriendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice aboutmy equity investments.
Joey: The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes hisforehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But Ifigured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, theyre gonna start tothink that I dont own it. So I figured Ill wash it. Right? Monica, you got abucket and some soap I can borrow?
Joey: Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Joey: And thats just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take herupstate.
Joey: Sure!
Joey: Okay, take it easy.
Joey: Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Joey: Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now Im just polishing her up.
Joey: Yeah, but its my wax.
Joey: Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) Ill uh, save your parking spot.
Joey: Why not?
Joey: Yeah, so did I.
Joey: (entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took hiscar back.
Joey: No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks Iown a Porsche.
Joey: Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have thecar! Right?
Joey: Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts toleave.)
Joey: Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk toher! (Storms out.)
Joey: Why isnt that valet back with my Porsche?
Joey: (to women passing him) Porsche.
Joey: Hi! How are the Gellers? 
Joey: Hey! Its Porsche!! (Hes right yknow.)
Joey: Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche! 
Joey: Hey! How you doin?
Joey: Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. Shes sleeping.(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then thesame guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapsesit. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)
Joey: Right! And when is that due?
Joey: And thats every month?
Joey: Ahhh.
Joey: (looking at it) Oh my God!!
Joey: No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charityanymore.
Joey: No! Forget it! OkayI mean thanks, but Im done taking moneyfrom you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, whats next? Come on.
Joey: This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Joey: Hey!
Joey: I dont know Ross, not if youre gonna talk about how you gaveup a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
Joey: (quietly) Ive got Ben.
Joey: Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Joey: Oh thats okay. Hey, actually in a way its kinda nice. Me,bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Joey: What, are you crazy? You havent beaten me once since my injuryplagued 97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Joey: Okay, youre on.
Joey: (scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! Thats like 500 bucks you owe me!Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.)$500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, theres nothing in the fridge.)Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.
Joey: You serious?
Joey: Okay, get ready to owe me!
Joey: Okay, here we go. Ready?
Joey: This sucks man! The last night youre here and I lose the two mostimportant things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Joey: Nah, not my game.
Joey: Well, whats it called?
Joey: I dont know how to play Cups.
Joey: All right.
Joey: A two and a five.
Joey: Really?!
Joey: A four and a nine.
Joey: No. Why?
Joey: Damn! I am good at Cups!
Joey: Well, what did you have?
Joey: Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.
Joey: Yeah.

Joey: Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500to him in Cups!
Joey: The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Rossgets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross wasgetting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnteven get half a cup! Nothin!!
Joey: And he never played before either! Yknow what I think? I thinkbeginners luck, very important in Cups.
Joey: No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! Im serious this time!In-in fact, look, theres aI wanna give you something. And let me give it tooyou know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I wantyou to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, yknow, thank you for being such agreat roommate.
Joey: Its him, not it!
Joey: Wait a second, I see what youre trying to do here! You-youretrying to give me money again!
Joey: Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried togive some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice lastnight together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Nowout of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Joey: I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your headthat I cant take care of myself. Okay? Look, Im not gonna miss you helping meout with money. The only thing that Im gonna missis you. And now the dog.
Joey: Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be mynew roommate!
Joey: Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
Joey: I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Joey: (shocked) From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Joey: You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
Joey: Oh, hey let me. (Opens the door for Janine and after he closes the doorbehind her gasps ecstatically.)
Joey: Of course I did.
Joey: "When can you move in?"
Joey: Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Joey: Oh God, yeah.
Joey: (happily) Okay!
Joey: Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Joey: Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around anattractive woman and not flirt.
Joey: You a little sad about that sweetheart?
Joey: (jumps out of the box) I Gotcha!!
Joey: Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looksgreat!
Joey: (raises his hand) I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australiandancer.
Joey: Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built upflirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. (Gives Chandler the"Joey-love," look.) How you doin?
Joey: (voice cracking) Ohhhh man
Joey: No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I needto do my stretches too. (Starts to stretch, groans painfully)
Joey: (jumps up and yells) 
Joey: Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm allsweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. (Goes into the bathroom and comes backout quickly) Oh my God!
Joey: (entering) Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'mdrawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (Tries to put his feet on the coffeetable...they won't reach and looks around.) What the hell's going on over here?!?!?(Points to Chandler) Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to dosomething to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women allthe time. 
Joey: No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman butsomehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Joey: This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Joey: Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Joey: Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Joey: All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You'rehot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates andit's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Joey: No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket andyou will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Joey: Oh!
Joey: Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Joey: Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?

Joey: No.
Joey: No.
Joey: (With Big Eyes.) All right, youre right. Ill talk to her.
Joey: Im a man.
Joey: (Grunting) Hmm. (Monica opens the front door and comes in.)
Joey: Or maybe, its because youre hanging around here at 11:30 on aWednesday. (Everybody gets up.)
Joey: Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Doyou, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
Joey: Yeah, thats what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhhLook Janine I reallywant you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. Itstoo girly.
Joey: Like this. (pointing to the picture) Pictures of cute babies we dontknow. We..we cant have that.
Joey: Look I dont know this baby. I dont know if shes a famousartist or not. You know, and I dont want to be a jerk but youre changing toomuch around here.

Joey: (Voice cracking) Well thats like summer in a bowl.
Joey: Hey Chandler. Come on in. Were knitting pot holders.
Joey: So whats really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in afrying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Joey: Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)
Joey: What?
Joey: Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers theyre just, you know,theyre nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of afamous baby.

Joey: Im sorry but weve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff inhere. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay?Thats just the way it has to be.
Joey: GreatGreatand thanks for being so understanding. I mean, Ididnt want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (She starts to collect all thegirlie stuff up.) You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, ifyou want to.

Joey: Well youre whippin so slow! Cant you do it any faster?
Joey: Oh I am!
Joey: Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Joey: Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Joey: Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, theyre allgonna make fun of her, do you want that?
Joey: (scolding) Dude, theyre not objects.
Joey: Just kiddin, Ill talk to them, you distract Rach.
Joey: Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word toindicate to Ross that hes not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh ifanyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh,rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh!And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?

Joey: I know. And shes so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brushher hair.
Joey: Totally! I would love to spend New Years with you.

Joey: Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. Were going to a NewYears Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back,great! Yknow? But if she says Dude, what the hell are you doing? I cansay It wasnt me, it was New Years!
Joey: OK, listen Ive been on sets before, so let me give you a littleadvice, alright? Its a show, but were just dancing, OK? Its no big deal.The important thing to remember  stay cool.

Joey: I know! I know! And Im going to talk to them about it. They mean somuch to me. They Theyre like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting allthe time, I-I I dont think we can be together. It just, it just cantwork. It cant. (Starts to break up) Im very upset.
Joey: Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for herand she exits into the hallway.)
Joey: Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?

Joey: Well, when its not right, you know it.
Joey: Yeah! Yeah. Ill be all right.

Joey: (laughing hysterically) Youre right! That did cheer me up!
Joey: (entering) Hey guys.
Joey: Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there,right?
Joey: Lets go watch it at your place.
Joey: Chandler, Chandler, yknow what we should do? You and I should go outand get some new sunglasses.
Joey: No, thats VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listento today . . . Its like a lotta noise to me. I dont know
Joey: I uh, oh! Because, uh, I havent really paid the bill
Joey: No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been alittle tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. 
Joey: I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen tothe radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).
Joey: Sure.
Joey: Not so much.
Joey: You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Joey: Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, butIm not even sure I got it.
Joey: Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im notworking, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.
Joey: Uh, I dont know. Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on asoap opera yknow? And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have towait on all my friends.
Joey: What?!
Joey: Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
Joey: (sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat backto bed.)
Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im headingup there.
Joey: Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? Cause Im going up there. 
Joey: (to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, cause Imheading up there. 
Joey: You got it.
Joey: Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a whats wrong withyou? look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)
Joey: Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if theyre inon a secret together.)
Joey: Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put onaprons. 
Joey: No.
Joey: Yeah?
Joey: Its kind of embarrassing, yknow. I mean, I was an actor andnow Im a waiter. Its supposed to go in the other direction.
Joey: I mean, the jobs easy and the moneys good, you know? I guessIm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? Ijust feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Joey: Okay, I guess it doesnt seem that weird.
Joey: See, now its weird again.
Joey: Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Yknow? Now, howabout clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. Its all about turnover.
Joey: Oh, Im sorry, Ross. Ill get it for you right now. And since Imade you wait, Ill toss in a free muffin.
Joey: Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Joey: Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, its a great part.Look, check it out. Im the lead guys best friend and I wait for him in thisbar and save his seat. Listen-listen. Im sorry, that seats saved.
Joey: Okay, maybe hes not his best friend, but 
Joey: Oh, man, I could totally get that part. Im sorry, that seat istaken.
Joey: No, no, I didnt mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Joey: So, youd hire me, right?
Joey: Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to beclosed for about an hour. 
Joey: Yeah, its for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. Its a veryimportant issue in this months Playboy. Im sure you all read about it.
Joey: Not good, no. I didnt get the part, and I lost my job here, so
Joey: Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be incharge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Joey: Yeah, what are ya gonna do?

Joey: I thought we talked about this. I dont like pulp. No pulp. Pulpisnt juice. All juice, okay?
Joey: Oh my God, Im sorry, Im being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.)Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.

Joey: (climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do youready for a refill?
Joey: Pretty cool, huh? But if youre thinking you can put a fish in thereand it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.
Joey: Its uh, right through there. (Points.)
Joey: Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?
Joey: Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, Ipretty much have to make it up on my own.
Joey: Yeah you did.

Joey: When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Joey: Come, come here. 
Joey: (entering) Morning!
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Joey: No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Joey: Wh-why?

Joey: Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the showwhen-when Caprice was dying and she gave me

Joey: Sure! As long as they dont find out you can keep whatever you want!And I want you to have it.
Joey: Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that youare a good person. Okay, youve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but youdidnt. And thats what this ring stands for.
Joey: Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Joey: Hey!

Joey: But you got to be with both of them, right?
Joey: Not the other one?
Joey: Yeah, you dont want that.
Joey: Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Joey: You got a little bored?
Joey: Yeah? What did ya have?
Joey: Sounds good.
Joey: (hes just picked up their bill) Hey! So, whats with the 20percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Joey: Yknow whats more generous than that?! Fifty percent!Yknow whats even more generous than that?!!
Joey: All right, look Im sorry you guys, but its just that I gottaget these new head shots made. And theyre really expensive, yknow? Imdown to like three! Well, actually two cause one of em I kinda blackened insome teethWhy did I do that?! (Hits himself in the head.)
Joey: Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments downon me all the time!
Joey: No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?Lets see uh, well I dont want to donate sperm again. (To Ross) I really preferdoing that at the home office yknow? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh-ooh, maybe they wantlike some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?

Joey: Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points toone.)
Joey: But its $2,000.
Joey: Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani onattractive nurse receptionists.
Joey: (in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin.Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot toreveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then backat his script.)
Joey: (entering) No! No! No! No! No! How you doin?! How youdoinDamnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! (Goes into the hall.)
Joey: Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Joey: Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for amedical research project.
Joey: Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Yknow? Theonly problem is, Carls acting is (Does the international hand symbol forso-so.)
Joey: Yeah, hes the reason I didnt get that big Minute Maidcommercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messedit up.

Joey: Damnit Carl!
Joey: Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Joey: Oh, cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with thesame handwriting and boom, theres your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)
Joey: Oh, well think of it like this, when youre 90
Joey: No thats not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going tosay is when youre 90 youll still have the memory of what it was like to bewith a 20-year-old.
Joey: Hey Chandler! Yknow that girl you went to college with who-whobecame a movie director?

Joey: This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) Anduh thats where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)
Joey: I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)
Joey: This is where I keep the pizza. (Its the same location as before.)AndHey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in its spot.)
Joey: (in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hairstraightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, itwas the candles. Its very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of thefirst things they teach you in fire school is (Phoebe suddenly enters.) UhhUhh Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)
Joey: Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean whats more important? Whatpeople think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.

Joey: Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs ascrewdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit andshocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!

Joey: What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Joey: Oh-ho-ho, you think I dont know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!(He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! Thatll be $400!

Joey: I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just dont know ifIm good enough.
Joey: You really think so?
Joey:  Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how towork the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Joey:  It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimesyou need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take thisbig pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look whereit looks like he's smelling a fart.)
Joey: (there's a gunshot on TV) There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey ontv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.  I'mafraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering froma..." (Does the smell-the-fart look.)

Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!Ross: You're right, you're right, it is.
Joey: All right well, Im outta here. Wish me luck.

Joey: Yeah, did I fool ya?
Joey: Oh, it went amazingly well!
Joey: Yeah-yeah, its down to me and two other guys.

Joey: Im just so nervous! Yknow? The callback isnt untiltomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Joey: Theres just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guysdo is very different. I dont know if youd understand.
Joey: I want this part so much! Yknow? If I dont get this partIm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!No, I didnt saythat! Thats a lie.
Joey: Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch likea real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Joey: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) What are you talking about? Theauditions not til 5:00!

(Listens and turns around to see Chandlertrying to finish the message.) Nevermind! (Hangs up.)
Joey: The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Joey: How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part couldve turned mywhole career around!
Joey: Hey, you dont even live here anymore! What are you doing answeringmy phone? I have my machine!

Joey:  What?!! Thats even worse!!
Joey:  I dont know! But its the same!
Joey:  Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line,that you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Joey: Name one!
Joey: (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!!
Joey:  Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said hedidnt think big enough to fit a grown man!
Joey:  I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into thatguy again, do you know what Im gonna do?
Joey: No way!  I've been going to the guy for 12 years.

Joey: Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then Ill just have to carryyou.
Joey: Ross, you dont have to yell.
Joey: Yknow what? I think thats enough for today. Thanks for yourhelp! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)
Joey: (entering) Hey guys!
Joey: Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? Ive dreamed about thisfor years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Joey: But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I dont know anythingabout technology! I cant even use Chandlers computer except to find porn!And-and thats only cause its right there when you turn it on!

Joey: Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot,yknow? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
Joey: Im sorry, it justI dont know it doesnt really looklike it can do anything.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Joey: Anyway, it wasnt the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah,he doesnt like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I wasreaching for one! Ohh!
Joey: I may have to, I hate to do it, but Im the star! Yknow?Theres a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. (His cell phonerings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone) Joey Tribbiani. 
Joey: Wow!
Joey: Im the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Joey: Apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play Mac,and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didnt knowhe could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Joey: Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.

Joey: YeahHey, dont worry, shes a terrific girl. And heylisten, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that Imnot looking for a serious relationship; thatd be great.
Joey: Just casually slip it in, yknow lay the groundwork. Tell her uh,Im a lonerNo! An outlaw! Tell her she doesnt want to get mixed up withthe likes of me.
Joey: Hey, Im gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used todo it! Hed even make the girl pancakes! Plus, hed make extras and leaveem for me.
Joey: Fine! (Pause) Now, whered we land on those pancakes? (She chases himout the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)
Joey: Hey! Whats up?
Joey: Hey-hey, whos your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey,startling him) Hey!!

Joey: No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Joey: Man, do you know what guys want!
Joey: My beers?! Look you guys, shes a very nice girl. Okay? We had a goodtime, but I justI dont see it going anywhere.
Joey: Look Im sorry you guys, I-I just dont think so.
Joey: Hey, dont start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? Youre the onewhos in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, youre the onehaving the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Joey: Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?

Joey: (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Joey: No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than thefirst time we went out. Yknow? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Joey: Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She lovessandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were everto have kids, well thats a
Joey: Okay.
Joey: How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
Joey: What about Game 1 of the Series?
Joey: You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)Ill be right back. 
Joey: (returning) Hey! You wanna go?
Joey: Okay. See you guys later.
Joey: (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to thisice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still And guess what, Imthinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Joey: No-no-no-no-no! Its a surprise, but its gonna be trickythought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Joey: Where are you gettin this?
Joey: Oh. Oh.
Joey: No hey Rach, its cool okay? Yknow Im a loner too! (Headsfor his room.) Right?
Joey: No! No. Dont do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Joey: Yeah?
Joey: (coming back out) Finally!
Joey: Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. 
Joey: Fifty-six! 
Joey: Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team! 
Joey: 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states? 
Joey: (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot onthere that you don't have. 
Joey: But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? 
Joey: Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. 
Joey: What the hell is in there? 
Joey: Yeah that dog left! 
Joey: (interrupting him) Don't do it! 
Joey: Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)
Joey: Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It'slike Ross not likin ice cream. 
Joey: Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
Joey: All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Becauseif he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. 
Joey: Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. 
Joey: Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package isthis pretty, no one cares what's inside. 
Joey: (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, youshould go for it! 
Joey: (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachelmoves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed) 
Joey: (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees thatChandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter? 
Joey: So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. 
Joey: Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Joey: Ross, you need some help? 
Joey: (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just makestuff up!
Joey: Hey! Tag's still talking to the police. 
Joey: If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. 
Joey: Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Joey: You think? 
Joey: Hey.
Joey: I do. Theres uh, lets see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-LotLady, Some Kids Ive Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Joey: Yeah?
Joey: Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there wasonly a couple of pieces left!
Joey: Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because somethingmightve happened to a huge chunk of it.
Joey: Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Joey: (about to cry) Those two only had each other!
Joey: Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin it by the park.
Joey: Hey Pheebs?
Joey: Hey Rach?
Joey: That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something likethis? (He shows her what hes been drawing.)
Joey: Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could affordporn.
Joey: (watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Joey: Yeah lady! Give us candy!!

Joey: Cage closed?
Joey: All right, I should get going, big day a work. Yknow Im in acoma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out Im not brain dead.

Joey: Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin here?
Joey: Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Joey: Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at itagain. The waiter leaves.) Yknow what Pheebs?
Joey: You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Joey: Yknow-yknow what I really want?
Joey: Is to have a long, long talk. Yknow? Get Joey out on the open roadand really open him up.
Joey: Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Joey: Whats the rush? What?
Joey: Whoa-whoa, what is it?

Joey: No, Im gonna!! Thats right! Yeah, you made me feel reallyguilty about goin out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible toyou! And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing!

Joey: Hey, yknow you could always visit him.
Joey: Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Joey: I can give it a shot.
Joey: (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin? (Starts diggingin.)
Joey: (looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Yknow whatelse makes you wonder?
Joey: Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Rossand finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes andstarts looking for the comet.)
Joey: Then why are you wearing Monicas jacket?
Joey: (whispering) Ross!
Joey: Come here, check this out!
Joey: No! No-no. Look, theres a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends downto get a closer look.)
Joey: (standing up) Yknow, theres two women dude.
Joey: Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)
Joey: (annoyed) I dont know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.)(Pause) Yeah, I do.
Joey: What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one whowanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
Joey: (covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on thedoor.)
Joey: Come on!
Joey: All right well, yknowI guess we know what we have to do to getdown.
Joey: Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points itout.)
Joey: All right, it wont go down any further. Its stuck.
Joey: Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Joey: What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Joey: (looks at the ground and at Ross) I dont know Ross! I-I tell youwhat, lets flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
Joey: No.
Joey: What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! Im not jumping! Okay, look I have anaudition tomorrow and I cant go if I break my leg.

Joey: Yeah? Really? No ones home?
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: All right! Just hurry up!
Joey: I think face to face.
Joey: Face to face, yeah!
Joey: All right. 
Joey: (grunting) Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?!
Joey: Yknow, when we talked about face to face, I dont think wethought it all the way through.
Joey: Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
Joey: Hi.
Joey: (angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Joey: Its not that far! Just drop!
Joey: Ross, you should know that my pants are startin to come down andIm not wearing any underwear!
Joey: Hey.
Joey: What are you doing?
Joey: (laughs) Why would you want to do that?
Joey: Rach, there is a decent place to
Joey: No. No. No.
Joey: No. Rosita does not move.
Joey: As in Rosita does not move.
Joey: The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom tothe kitchen and its at the perfect angle so you dont get any glare coming ofoff Stevie.
Joey: (glaring at her) Is there a problem?
Joey: I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted tomove you mom, and you said dont, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Joey: (slowly turning and glaring at her) Shes not even cold yet!
Joey: Thats true.
Joey: Yeah, I (Shuts off the TV.) I dont want Stevie to see her likethis.
Joey: No I wont.
Joey: Because, I know what I like and what I dont like! Its not thesame thing!
Joey: I dont know why you say that so soon.
Joey: Francette? What is she? A couch?
Joey: Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Joey: Well, I guess youre right. Maybe, maybe Ill take her down tothe incinerator. Its gonna be so said, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back,but it doesnt come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, andlooks back at it.) Shes heeled!
Joey: No its not weird, its a miracle!
Joey: Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrousthings can happen!
Joey: (interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?
Joey: Miracle!
Joey: Someone like anangel?
Joey: (angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and headsfor her room.)
Joey: Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)
Joey: Fine.
Joey: No. Really?
Joey: (quietly) My chair heels itself.
Joey: Well, it looks like it wasnt heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guessthis chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)
Joey: Your chair?!
Joey: So, there was no miracle?!
Joey: (sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. Im soglad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Joey: How do you figure?
Joey: Thats right!
Joey: Yeah! We are!
Joey: Oh yeah.

Joey: Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Joey: (screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Notme!! (He buries his head in Phoebes lap for comfort.)
Joey: (screaming) And now Chandler! Were all gettin so old! (Lookingup) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)
Joey: Yeah, youre roommate is a soap opera star.
Joey: Hey, whats the horsepower on this thing?
Joey: But it hurts my Joeys Apple.
Joey: Well actually
Joey: Dude, you soooo need this car.

Joey: Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from youguys?
Joey: Will you quit hoggin it!
Joey: (to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I nottell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
Joey: Yeah!!
Joey: Oh, I dont know Pheebs. Itll be okay.
Joey: Thats not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!
Joey: Like what?
Joey: Hey, yknow what you guys? I think Im gonna go walk her home.(Gets up and runs out.) 
Joey: Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so andJoey passionately kisses her.) Maybe thats one thing you can cross off your list.
Joey: Oh, and plus Im 1/16th Portuguese.
Joey: Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Joey: Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Joey: Okay! (Runs off downstairs.)
Joey: Yes!
Joey: (entering, limping, and holding his arm) I dont like this anymore.(He sits down with them in pain.)
Joey: (crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head inRosss shoulder.)
Joey: All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Lets go!
Joey: No.
Joey: (entering, excited) Hey!
Joey: So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and
Joey: Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, youre not gonna believe it! Mycharacter is coming out of his coma!!
Joey: And-and-and not only that, Im gettin a new brain!!
Joey: Oh well, theyre killing off one of the characters on the show, andwhen she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
Joey: (seriously) Yes, its a highly controversial procedure.
Joey: Well, I think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in threeand a half months.
Joey: Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Joey: Nice.
Joey: Oh, tell me about it. And shes been on the show forever, itsgonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Joey: Yes, but in Drake Remorays body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why isthis so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Joey: That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you dothat?
Joey: Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Joey: Say what?
Joey: No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday.I-Im the guy in the coma!
Joey: An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brainwhen you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
Joey: (quickly) I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
Joey: Oh uh, one of the writers.
Joey: Umm
Joey: Okay.
Joey: Ms. Monroe (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leavingJoey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they justreceived.)
Joey: So you like the nachos uh? Myself Im partial to
Joey: See you in 2003. (She walks away.)
Joey: Im so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave theshow.
Joey: No I mean it! I cant believe they would do this to you! And to yourfans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Joey: Joey.
Joey: Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-yel-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I,that I came up to you before was because well, Im really nervous about-about beingyou. Yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Yknow?Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Joey: Oh thats great! Oh thank you so much!
Joey: Hey! Now, Ive been watching some tapes, hows this? (In aBritish accent.) "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!Ever!!"
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: (shocked) I can do an English accent?! That babys going on myresume!
Joey: Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed)All right!
Joey: Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)
Joey: Oh wellHey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing.Yknow? Itll-itll give you a chance to shake things up, play differentcharacters. Youre so talented.
Joey: Hey thats not true! Look at uh, look at Angela LansbAngelinaJolie!
Joey: Like-like what?
Joey: (impressed) Wow!
Joey: Oh hey come on, dont-dont-dont do this! Umm, looklet-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, Im thinking,"Boy, she-she is a great actress!" (Shes not buying it.) Uh but-but, I amalso thinking, "She is hot!"
Joey: You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) Weshould probably get-get uh
Joey: Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that cause shes so passionate?
Joey: Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
Joey: Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Joey: (shrugs) Sure. Yep.
Joey: Okay, bye-bye.
Joey: All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of theapartment.)
Joey: Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (ToCecilia) I-I am so sorry. I
Joey: (notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!
Joey: They sent me todays script! They never send the script!
Joey: Well no, Im just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizeswhat that means.) Oh
Joey: (flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into anelectric fence.
Joey: Yeah well, Im guessing after this shes not going to be crazyabout electricity either.
Joey: (as Jessica) I dont think so.
Joey: Oh noo
Joey: Thanks!
Joey: Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Joey: The airport?

Joey: Good luck.
Joey: I call it!!
Joey: Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Joey: So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Joey: Well then let me do it!
Joey: No-no-no! Look, Ive been thinking about it. Im an actor right?So I wont get nervous talking in front of people.
Joey: No-no-no-no look no! I wont spit, and I wont stare atMonicas breasts! Yknow? Everyone knows Im an ass man!
Joey: Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like,stranger up there who barely knows you. Itll be me! And I swear Ill do areally good job. Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot tome.
Joey: So I can do it?

Joey: Anyway, I started working on what Im going to say for the ceremony,do you wanna hear it?
Joey: Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so (Starts to read thepiece of paper he brought.) "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion tocelebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." (Monica and Chandler likeit so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) "It is a love based on giving and receiving.As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared andreceived. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (Phoebe nodsher approval.) "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Joey: Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Joey: (reading) "When I think of the love that these two givers andreceivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving andgiving and" And then I cant think of a good word for right here. (Hepoints to the stop on the paper where he left off.)

Joey: A woman in a mans body.

Joey: So youve just married the one time then?
Joey: (laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well nowwhy did that firstmarriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Joey: No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a womanon the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Joey: Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Joey: Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Joey: Monkey lover!

Oh Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, Ididnt prepare a speech. But umm, Id like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) myparents, whove always been there for me.

Joey: Kay! 
Joey: What the?! (Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and whichis drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that hes on TVright now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)
Joey: (angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated forthis award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his headin disgust.)

From One Life to LiveMary Loren Bishop (They start to applaud again, but Joey interrupts in with the rest ofthe nominees), from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our LivesJessica Ashley. And the winner is(Opens the envelope)Jessica Ashley from Daysof Our Lives. (Applause) Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldnt be with us tonight soIll be accepting this award on her behalf. (Realizes something) And Im surethat Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. Shed alsolike to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel whossittin right there! (Points at Rachel.) (The music starts and his microphone isturned off, this angers Joey again and he disgustedly exits.)
Joey: Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won! (He whips outthe award for Best Supporting Actress that he accepted for Jessica.)
Joey: No-no! No, Im accepting it on her behalf. (He puts it up above theTV to display it.)
Joey: Sure I do! Its a verb! As in, "I behalfin it!"
Joey: But why?! I shouldve won one and I really want it and shedidnt even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Joey: Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full ofem.
Joey: No! I want an award I did win! But nobodys giving me any of those!PlusHey Rach, if-if I put it up there (Points to the TV) right? When people comeover theyll see it and theyll think I won it.
Joey: I can scratch that right off.
Joey: All right!
Joey: Ill take it back tomorrow.
Joey: (opening his door) If I cant have it you cant have it! (Rachelwalks away angrily.)
Joey: Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.

Joey: Well, that-that-thats it? Youre gonna, youre gonna putit on your self or anything?
Joey: (To Rachel) Take it back?
Joey: Y-y-yeah! (As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase withflowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)
Joey: Im sorry, do I know you?
Joey: Nothing, Im just practicing blowing you off because Im gonnabe a big movie star!
Joey: Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Joey: Oh, its this big budget period movie about these three Italianbrothers who come to America around the turn of the century. Its really classy! Oh,and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
Joey: Yeah, theres this guy from Chicago whos supposed to be thenext Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guys right after him. (Joeyscell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!
Joey: (to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!
Joey: (on phone) Oh my God!
Joey: Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh.(Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)
Joey: They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Joey: I know! My grandmothers gonna see this!
Joey: I dont know! Its not like its porn! This is a serious,legitimate movie. Yknow? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Joey: Youre right. Maybe I shouldnt even go on the call back.
Joey: Well thats true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it soundsreally great. My characters catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Whorun away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn andundress each other and hold each other. Its really sweet and-and tender.
Joey: Hey, Im back!
Joey: Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Joey: Oh great! Yknow I wouldve been perfect for this part, butwhatever! Yknow, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!(Starts to leave.)
Joey: And scene! Huh? Wasnt that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah!Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Joey: Wow! Sure! Thats great!
Joey: Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as its handled tastefully and that barnis not too cold.
Joey: SoWhat?
Joey: Yes!
Joey: No. What?
Joey: Barmifsaed?
Joey: Nope.
Joey: Yep.
Joey: Thats right.
Joey: I dont know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matterwhat you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse,you tell em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Joey: I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meetthe director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Joey: I just have to call my agent and tell her I cant do the part. (Getsup for the phone.)
Joey: Unless what?
Joey: Like what?
Joey: Wow! This looks great!
Joey: And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Joey: Thank God!
Joey: Ah.
Joey: Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)
Joey: Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Joey: Ow!
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: The fruit roll up.
Joey: Delicious.
Joey: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Joey: The Silly Putty! Its not so silly anymore!
Joey: And whats cool is, the character is from Naples, right? 
Joey: My whole familys from Naples!
Joey: Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) Itotally understand. You need to yknow make sure I dont have any horrible scarsor tattoos. Dont you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and standsback up and looks down.) So there you go, thats me. (We cut to a camera anglelooking at the casting director and movie director through Joeys legs.) One hundredpercent natural! (Suddenly, theres a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone isshocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Joey: Probably Monica and Chandler.
Joey: Hey guys! Look whos back! Its Ray-ray!
Joey: (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!
Joey: (excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who youwhat?!!
Joey: What?!
Joey: (entering) Hello!
Joey: Hey Rach. (Stares at her.) 
Joey: Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Joey: What theyre not invited?! Oh no, thats terrible! Theyregonna be crushed!
Joey: (looking around) You got me. I dont
Joey: Well, Im sorry. I thought parents were coming! Yknow? Yourparents are comin! Chandlers parents are comin! Rosss parents arecomin!
Joey: Well-wellsee? Parents are comin!
Joey: (leaning down to her) Maybe youll order a little sangria?
Joey: We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)
Joey: Nice move.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: No, Im performing the ceremony. Im not wearing a tux.
Joey: Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
Joey: I dont think so.
Joey: (excitedly) Can I come?! I wont even talk! Youll just hear thenoise from my video camera.
Joey: Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Joey: Okay
Joey: Hey. (Laughs then seriously) It happened!
Joey: Why are you taking this away from me?
Joey: Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Yeah, theyre not coming.
Joey: Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.Theyfeel a little unwanted.
Joey: Look Mon, if you could just call my mom
Joey: Come on! Look just-just telllet her know that you really want themto be there. Lets not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas overthe years.
Joey: Is it her fault that some of them didnt make it to you?
Joey: I dont know. Just uh, just tell em it was a mix-up with theinvitations, orNo-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the postoffice. And the Irish! But I dont think you can blame it on them so (He dialsthe phone and hands it to Monica.)
Joey: (entering) Hey.
Joey: Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you wantpeople to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Joey: Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, its gonna start alittle late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Joey: Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is its the same day as mynieces christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.Cause my parts just in the beginning Im not even in the rest of theshowWedding!
Joey: Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a littletil they get there?
Joey: Yeah! Yeah yknow, like warm up the crowd. Ask em wheretheyre from. Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get anentertainer. Im a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no one better! There is no onegreater!
Joey: (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Joey: No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents,that was really sweet. Theyre so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Joey: Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!(Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like thiswhen I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for partytime.
Joey: All right, uh (To Ross) Oh hey, youve done this before Ross,well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Joey: Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica
Joey: "when I look back over our time together"
Joey: Well, I cant do everything! Look back over your time together.
Joey: (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! Were dying out here!
Joey: Hey!
Joey: How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Joey: (shocked) Has it been that long?!
Joey: Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Joey: Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Joey: Okay.
Joey: I know! I mean its not like we werent cool about it.
Joey: (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
Joey: How?! When?!
Joey: IN LONDON!!!
Joey: But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
Joey: All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Joey: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of usknow that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets wouldfinally be over!
Joey: Well I didn't tell them!
Joey: Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Joey: And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Joey: No.
Joey: They know you know.
Joey: I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Joey: (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Joey: Ooh!
Joey: I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)

Joey: Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your highheels are good for his posture!
Joey: Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Joey: Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Joey: Youve seen my huge stack of porn right? (Phoebe nods.)
Joey: Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)
Joey: Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebethat hes got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!
Joey: Yknow, Im beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Joey: The silk? Feels really good!
Joey: Yeah! And-and things arent assmashed down as I thought theywere gonna be.
Joey: Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do withmens underwear!
Joey: Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! Youve got cotton,silk, lace! And yknow what Ive always wondered about?
Joey: Pantyhose! Yknow? They way they start at your toe and go all the wayup to here (He mimed that and stops when he realized he went to far.) I should gotake these off shouldnt I?
Joey: Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about mymanhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like rightnow.

Joey: Wow Dennis Phillips! Thats great! How did you guys meet?
Joey: Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldve done it all, film,television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thats just for uglypeople.

Joey: And-and you wont blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbsup.)
Joey: Uh, okay Ill-Ill-Ill break it down. (He hands the phoneto Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)

Joey: Six months? Whoa thats rough.
Joey: The skys blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Joey: Okay. Okay. UmmOoh! Oh-oh, I got something. Its this story Icame up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; theyre like putty.
Joey: Okay. Now youre gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, butyou have to remember it is just the story.
Joey: Okay. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was backpacking across WesternEurope
Joey: Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.)
Joey: I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. Iwas at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded.And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly)And across the lake I sawa beautiful womanbathing herselfbut she wascrying
Joey: Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
Joey: Hey! Look, if it didnt work its because you didnt tellit right! Show me how you did it.
Joey: How long since youve seen a girl naked?
Joey: Im not feeling it.
Joey: No! No! No Ross! Im not hot! Are you hot?
Joey: Well youre not selling the story! Its like; its like youdont believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do whenIm preparing for an audition. Okay? Ill set you up with my video camera andyou can record yourself and-and see what youre doing wrong.
Joey: All right now All right, youre all set up. Youre good togo. Just hit record. All right?
Joey: Good luck.
Joey: Yeah?
Joey: (trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)
Joey: Yknow what? This is not fair to her. Lets just forget thetape!
Joey: Youre right. (Mouths, "I know youll show me, right?)
Joey: Loud and clear! (Mouths, "Youll show me," and nods.)
Joey: Yknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didntgive you real names either.
Joey: Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Joey: Uh no Rach, hes gone. But listen, he told us what happened and itdoes, it sounds like an honest mistake.
Joey: (confused) Are we watchin the tape or not?!
Joey: (To Phoebe) Im so happy!
Joey: How do you know about that story?!
Joey: (raises his hand) Some guy!! (Points to himself.)

Joey: Its no Ukrainian film.

Joey: No
Joey: Well, I was thinking that itd probably be okay because Rosshasnt gone out with Rachel in five years!
Joey: Hey! Im an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! Imnot sure. I think theyre taking the ferry out to some Italian place on StatenIsland.
Joey: Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go likefive miles an hour?
Joey: Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
Joey: So what movie do you want to seeAnd not another one I have to read.Okay? I get enough of that from books.
Joey: All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but its like enough!

Joey: Why?
Joey: They go on one date and youre worried about them getting married?!Hes not you!
Joey: Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
Joey: What do you mean?
Joey: Thats a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
Joey: Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and yourwife, is your wife Rachel?
Joey: Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isnt Rachel.
Joey: I know, but I dont think thats what she wants.
Joey: Thats okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? Its notgonna be what you thought, but no matter what theres gonna be a brand new littlebaby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
Joey: Hey, I tell you what. Lets you and me go out and have some fun. Huh?Whatever you want. Come on!
Joey: No, I said fun!
Joey: Look, Ill come to the party but Im not dressing up.

Joey: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Yes I did! Im Chandler. (Looks at Chandler) Dude, what happened?

Joey: When have I ever done that?! (And does the sound again.)
Joey: (sees Ross) Hey all right, Ross came as doody.

Joey: Im not sure.
Joey: Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? Itdoesnt matter.
Joey: I would say, "Woman, please!"
Joey: (To Monica) Here comes the temper.
Joey: Okay, heres a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fightbetween Ross and Chandler.
Joey: So Ross?
Joey: (To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to ourquestion.
Joey: Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, youor Ross?
Joey: So you think Ross too?
Joey: Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came tosee a fight, lets give em what they came for!
Joey: Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
Joey: Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Joey: Rach?
Joey: (entering) Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! Were waiting! (They goinside.) (To Chandler and Ross.) Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. (They graspeach others hand in preparation for battle.) Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?

Joey: Come on! Youre good with kids. Theyre just crazy on Halloween.Yknow, theyre all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
Joey: Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmasand theirbirthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime theyre hungryor sleepy. Yknow, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)
Joey: (entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie ontide pools?

Joey: Oh, youre switching apartments?
Joey: But Rachel has an apartment.
Joey: She is?
Joey: I guess I didnt really think about it.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Oh, okay. II ate way too much.
Joey: Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I wastalkin to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
Joey: I was kinda hoping youd stay.
Joey: No room? Its a baby. Its like this big. (Holds his hands abouta foot apart.) Yknow, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.)Or-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, its cute, right? Or-or wecould put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldnt even notice it.Wheres the baby? (Mumbles that its over in the corner.)
Joey: I could use a challenge! Its getting pretty easy.
Joey: I love living with you so much. I just wish things didnt have tochange.
Joey: Yknow I blame Ross for this.
Joey: Im gonna miss you, youre the hottest roommate I ever had.
Joey: Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screenshere, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobileover the crib. And uhOh look! Heres a baby monitor (Holds it up), which untilthe baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
Joey: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. That-that-thats really just to show where thebaby would go. Yknow why dont I hold on to him so that theres noconfusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)
Joey: Im loud!
Joey: Im up all night!
Joey: Hello!
Joey: Look, if Im bringing home a woman who cant stand being arounda baby, then maybe I dont want to be with that woman! Or maybe well just do itin the bathroom of the club!
Joey: Yeah! All rightLook, I know sometimes itll be hard, okay? But,itll also be reallyreally great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
Joey: Ohh!
Joey: I know! I found it on the street.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: I dont know.
Joey: Ew.
Joey: Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)
Joey: Isnt that great?
Joey: Its a grand tradition!
Joey: This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend abachelor party, but no, I wasnt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
Joey: Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
Joey: So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. Hows it going?
Joey: Hot?
Joey: Im gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.

Joey: So you uh, nervous about getting married?
Joey: Look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party. Okay?Yknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itll be fun.
Joey: How does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another womanagain huh? Knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until youfinally have the sweet release of death.
Joey: Thats her! Okay, come on! (They go over and open the door.)
Joey: Uh, that-thats-thats me!
Joey: Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
Joey: Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
Joey: Yeah, thats one naked hooker!
Joey: Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she gotconfused about what shes supposed to do.
Joey: Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her ownhusband a hooker, thats pretty funny.
Joey: I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
Joey: (on machine) Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here andwe thought maybe youd know something about it.
Joey: Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
Joey: Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anythingyoure really bad at yknow, sexually?
Joey: In a minute!
Joey: All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
Joey: Hey! Its your bachelor party.
Joey: I dont want to. You do it!
Joey: You do it!
Joey: I miss this.
Joey: No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
Joey: Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable.Yknow now its likethings are different.
Joey: Oh sureAnd hey, dont get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys.I justI misshanging outjust-just us, yknow?
Joey: You got it. Come here. (They hug and are observed by the hooker.)
Joey: (on phone) Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!(Listens) What gives you the right to (Listens) Go to hell! (Hangs up the phone andopens the fridge.) Stupid guy on my phone.
Joey: Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell upto twice their size and never go back.
Joey: (laughing) You fall for it every time!
Joey: I just want you to say it once in a while.
Joey: What?!
Joey: Phoebe!
Joey: No theyre not! Theyre ugly and stupid and delicious!
Joey: She is?
Joey: Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand andmade it walk across the table.
Joey: But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with noturkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
Joey: No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
Joey: Thats right! Cause Im a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And thisis what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read alot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
Joey: Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomachfirst. Eatin chips is like stretching.
Joey: Dont worry, Tribbianis never get full.
Joey: (To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?
Joey: Oh hey!
Joey: Thats it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. Atleast give me a challenge!
Joey: (quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?
Joey: (To Rachel) Its like me when I was born.
Joey: (To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?
Joey: Im afraid Im gonna need proof.
Joey: You are my Everest.
Joey: Oh yes I do. Otherwise whats next? Today Im just a guy whocant finish a turkey, but tomorrow Im the guy who eats half a Powerbar,wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I justI justI gotta changemy pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)
Joey: (entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All rightwheres that turkey!
Joey: Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
Joey: Well thats it. Im done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There comethe meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)
Joey: No just, nobody press on my stomach.
Joey: Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Joey: Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.)A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves theknife again.) What?! Are you afraid youre gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
Joey: Oh hey Rach, listenHi!

Joey: (concerned) Oh. Whats, whats going on? Is it mom? Is she sick?Is it dads heart? Is that a sandwich?
Joey: Is that a sandwich?!
Joey: (angrily) What?!
Joey: Well obviously this is a mistake! You cant be pregnant! Because youhave to have sex to get pregnant!
Joey: (to Rachel) Bub!!! (Points at her and quiets Rachel.) (To Dina) Icant believe this! Youre the good one! You went to college! Both years! Whodid this to you?!
Joey: You got pregnant for funny?! Dinaif hes funnylaugh!All right, Ill be back in a little while! You stay here!
Joey: I cant look at you right now! (Exits and slams the door behind him.)
Joey: Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to jointhis man and this woman

Joey: Dina, if youre having a baby you should be married! Even if it is toBobby! (Bobby gets happy.) Dude, thats not a compliment!
Joey: So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? Youre gonna have thebaby and-and raise it by yourselfwithout a husband?! You cant be a singlemother alone! Youre gonna ruin your life!
Joey: No! No! No! Its different for you. Youre so strong andtogether. Youre not some dumb kid who doesnt know what shes doing.

Joey: Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.)
Joey: Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.(Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesnt move from hischair.)
Joey: Im missin picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares athim and he retreats.)
Joey: (To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!
Joey: Hey-hey-hey, hey thats your wife youre talking about!
Joey: Who was that?
Joey: You hung up on the pizza place? I dont hang up on your friends.
Joey: Oh, whats wrong?
Joey: Then why did I ask?
Joey: Is that college talk for horny?
Joey: Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Joey: Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
Joey: Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)
Joey: (entering) I cant do it!
Joey: Youre Rachel!
Joey: Youre my friend!
Joey: But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
Joey: I know!
Joey: Do you wanna do it?
Joey: All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
Joey: This conversation never happened!
Joey: Good night!
Joey: Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)
Joey: (To Rachel) Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Joey: Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm
Joey: I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
Joey: Ooh, great! Thanks!
Joey: You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, Ill tell ya
Joey: Hey, yknow what?
Joey: Why dont I take you out?
Joey: Yes I do! And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time,and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretchingout
Joey: Ill be fun.
Joey: No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you. (Hands hersome flowers.)
Joey: And, a brownie! (Hands her a bag with the brownie in it.) Well, half abrownie. Actually, its just bag. Its been a long walk from the flower shop andI was startin to feel faint so
Joey: Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, sonice place you got here.Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
Joey: I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Joey: Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?
Joey: Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Joey: No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Comeon!
Joey: Yknow what? Bring her both, and Ill have the same. (Thewaitress leaves.)
Joey: Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? Were on a date.
Joey: No! No. Umm, just myself and if they dont like me for(Laughs.)Im sorry I couldnt even get through that.
Joey: Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of winesent to my table from a fan.
Joey: Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, Ijust want to have a normal life!"
Joey: Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the nightto kiss you, but youre so beautifulI dont think I can.
Joey: Alright, soso tell me one of your moves.
Joey: Thats your move? Boy Rach, youre lucky youre hot.
Joey: (exasperated) Queens.
Joey: Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
Joey: I dont know. I guess theres just always been this distanceyknowI mean we both try to pretend its not there, but it is.
Joey: Yeah, it is. Its really tough. Yknow sometimes IthinkWow!! Nice move!
Joey: "Whered you grow up," its so simple!
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Yes I am! Again so simple!
Joey: Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross ifyou had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
Joey: Chandler?
Joey: Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
Joey: I never laughed so hardDid you see the wine come out of my nose?
Joey: I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date somuch.
Joey: Huh. Huh.
Joey: Ah! Okay, well then you dont judge me. Im gonna suck on thecellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)
Joey: Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lipslook irresistible. 
Joey: Now you cant tell anyone, but uhI put on shiny lip balm.
Joey: Yeah, like a moth to a flame, Im telling ya. Okay all right, so nowyou go.
Joey: Why not?
Joey: More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks athim.) I didnt say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, justtell me!
Joey: (stunned and turned on) Yeah. WhyYeah, that would work for ya
Joey: Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He thenstarts to freak out.)
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Oh yeah, I still cant believe you havent seen Cujo.What is wrong with you?
Joey: Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Joey: Oh yeah? All right, lets do it tonight.
Joey: Oh right!
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
Joey: Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
Joey: Yeah me too, all night.
Joey: Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, youdont want to look in my hamper.
Joey: No-no! Im fine. Its just Hey, can I ask you something?Have you ever looked at someone that youve known for a while and thensuddenlysuddenly see them a different way?
Joey: Yeah. Yeah, thatthats exactly it. Youre right. Yeah.
Joey: (deadpan) Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what Im talkingabout.
Joey: Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watchesher go.) Ehhh.
Joey: (incredulous) Alone?!
Joey: Hey, did you get to the part where theyre trapped in the car andCujos throwin himself at the windshield?
Joey: Oh uh, it didnt work out.
Joey: Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
Joey: Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)
Joey: All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.
Joey: Terrified. (But for a totally different reason.)
Joey: (thinking) All right. Its a new day. All that stuff aboutRachel, you dont feel that now. It was crazy! Youre fine.Youre better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat!Everythings normal! Shes just your friend Rachel! Your friendRachel. Your friend! Rachel.
Joey: (thinking) Hey, its your girlfriend, Rachel!
Joey: (entering) Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
Joey: Well, neither.
Joey: I dont know. Its-its justlately, Ive beenfeeling Okay, heres what it is (Pause) You know what? I feel a lotbetter, thanks! (Starts to leave)
Joey: All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there arerules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but thats different. I mean, there arerules there, too! You know what I mean?
Joey: It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the sameplace, right?
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me afavor, this conversation was between you and me.
Joey: Hey. Well, whats up?
Joey: What?
Joey: Whaaat?
Joey: Oh my God. You do?
Joey: I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for thoseguys. I mean, its Rachel for God sakes.
Joey: I know. I know. And shes not only my friend; shes my pregnantfriend! Shes my pregnant friend whos Ross ex!
Joey: What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid ofthese feelings, yknow? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything Idont like about her. You want to hear it?
Joey: She made me switch to light Mayo. Thats it! Thats all I got! And,you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
Joey: You think?
Joey: Yeah, just a crush! Thats all this is! Its a crush! ImJoey; I dont get deep feelings.
Joey: Not really.
Joey: (from outside the bathroom) Hello?
Joey: Why?
Joey: (entering the bathroom) What are you guys doing in here?
Joey: Its no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. Its just acrush! Its going to go away! (Looks down) Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles!Oh!
Joey: (thinking) All right. Its a new day, and its just acrush, thats all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing,that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "itwas cuckoo!" Everythings going to be fine. Its just a crush.
Joey: (thinking) I love you.
Joey: Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, werealmost there! Were almost there!
Joey: Oh, I love you too.
Joey: Thats always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. Onemore push! One more push!
Joey: What? Whats going on?
Joey: Aaaah
Joey: Really?!
Joey: Oh, yknow what? Maybe uh, youyou should come to me. Im anot, Im not wearing any bottoms.
Joey: Oh my, oh my God!
Joey: Mia Hamm?
Joey: Oh thats amazing. (Drops the sheet.)
Joey: Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
Joey: Hey Ross! The babys kicking!
Joey: A dreamless sleep.
Joey: Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.
Joey: Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
Joey: Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Joey: Why not?
Joey: I dont know. Ooh, I bet its Richard.
Joey: Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake andeating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
Joey: I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what wasbehind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugscame pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Yknow it wouldnt kill ya torespect your wifes privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks thedoor.) Stupid closet full of bugs!
Joey: Oh hey whoa-whoa, dont worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnantthey got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
Joey: Absolutely. But, were gonna stop by the hospital just to besure, okay? Ill page Ross on the way. Come on.
Joey: Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everythings gonna befine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushingbones!
Joey: Hey! So?
Joey: So but everything is normal.
Joey: And-and theres no danger to her and the baby?
Joey: Calm?! I wasnt calm! Ive never been more scared in all mylife!
Joey: Well what do I know?! Im not a doctor!
Joey: You sure?!
Joey: (seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!
Joey: Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Joey: Hey uh, whats with the candy?
Joey: Oh hey, dont worry about it man. Dont worry about it, no bigdeal.
Joey: Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) Hebrought Twizlers!
Joey: Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Joey: Then why do you throw like one?
Joey: Sure. "Monica."
Joey: Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself anyday now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure foundthat quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I justI wish I didnt feel this wayabout Rachel anymore, yknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I loveliving with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkIthink Ross feels left out. Yknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, thedoctor thought I was the father. God You shouldve seen the look on Rosssface. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what Im doing here. For all I know Imjust locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Oh, I justI feel terrible.
Joey: Whats going on?
Joey: Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Joey: Im on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)
Joey: Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Joey: Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Joey: Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Joey: The thing iscause I live with Rachel Im here for a lotof the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And RossRoss is missing everything. So
Joey: Maybe you two should live together.
Joey: Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems thatifyoure gonna have a roommate, yknow it might as well be the father.
Joey: All right now, so? What do you think?
Joey: Well, I was due.
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those becauseRachel couldnt stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juicewith calcium though. And uh, its a couple weeks past its expiration date, soits got a bit of a kick.
Joey: Are you kidding me? Im great! Yeah, Im uh; Im betterthan great. I am good. And now that shes gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuffaround here that I couldnt do before. Yknow? Like umm, I can walk around nakedagain. Yknow? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, thisis good for me. Yknow? I like being on my own, Im uh, better off this way.Im uh, a lone wolf. Yknow? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. Whats awolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)
Joey: Hey, so, uh, hows it going living over at Ross?
Joey: Bye.
Joey: Theres one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
Joey: Thanks. But maybe later.
Joey: You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman Ilove on Valentines Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one momentof relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that thats never going to happen!
Joey: Oh, okay. 
Joey: No, Im not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
Joey: Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
Joey: Thanks so much, Pheebs! (to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes weare! (the dog sticks his head between Joeys legs) Oh! Not that kind of fun.
Joey: Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! (Joey pretends to throw it,but really doesnt, and the dog goes running off.) Well, youre cute, butyoure not too smart! 
Joey: (looking at the ball the dog brought back) Did I just throw this?
Joey: Hi.
Joey: Oh, thats, uh, thats Phoebes friends dog. Idont know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.
Joey: (to the dog) Cmere. Hey. Cmere. Thats Rachel. Shesthe one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with youwe love her. But wecant have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? Youre aguy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) Well, you used to be.
Joey: So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it justisnt going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
Joey: Hey.
Joey: No.
Joey: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!
Joey: Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
Joey: Rachel stuff.
Joey: Hes breathing!
Joey: No, no, no, no! Hes fine! Look, look, look! (picks up the ball)Heres your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bouncesright next to the dog) Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke thedog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
Joey: Hey, whats up?
Joey: Oh, man, Im sorry. Why?
Joey: Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentines Day.
Joey: Sort of.
Joey: You dont have to seem so happy about it.
Joey: Oh, II d
Joey: Forget about it. Its no big deal.
Joey: Its nothing.
Joey: Okay, uhsit down. (they do) Um theres this woman that Ilike. A lot. But, uhit cant happen.
Joey: No!
Joey: Yes.
Joey: Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesnt matter, because Icant do anything about it.
Joey: Well, its complicated. Shes with this other guy. For a long time.Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because were reallygood friends.
Joey: No. I dont think so.
Joey: Yeah, hes the best.
Joey: Oh, I dont know.
Joey: I do! So much! I cant stop thinking about her! I cant sleep,I
Joey: Oh, yeah.
Joey: Its Rachel.
Joey: Theres this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, itscomplicated.  Shes with this other guy.  For a long time.  And Icould never do that to the guy, yknow?  Ccause were really goodfriends.

Joey: I do! So much! I cant stop thinking about her! I cant sleep,I
Joey: Its Rachel.

Joey: (startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uhHey-hey, yknow,yknow who else I like? You! And it-it doesnt get said enough. I like you Ross.
Joey: Yeah, but its not a big deal.
Joey: Im an actor, yknow? As-as a group, we tend to be overdramatic.
Joey: Look no, I-I know its bad, and I know its wrong. Okay? But-butits not like anythings ever gonna happen. Yknow? These-these are justfeelings, theyre gonna go away.
Joey: Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross dont
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Joey: Oh what then? Kick me?
Joey: (getting worried) Bite me?
Joey: Oh nowHey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer orsomething?
Joey: Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachelleft. I dont
Joey: (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand somethingokay? I uhI am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never doanything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)
Joey: Anyway, it uhlook itll justtake me a while to get overher, thats all. Im not even sure how to do that, I mean Ive never beenin love before so
Joey: Yeah, I thought you knew that.
Joey: Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I dont want to feel this way. Honest. Ijust keep thinking, "Ah, Ill get over this." Yknow? I justItjust keeps gettin harder. I dont, I dont know what to do. Yknow?What do I do?
Joey: Okay thats the green stuff talkin.
Joey: But what if uhand Im not saying she will beBut
Joey: Are you sure?
Joey: Hey thanks.
Joey: Oh my God I have to tell her! I havent even thought about what Iwill say. What should I say?
Joey: Im sorry, youre right. What am I gonna say? (He takes anothersip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!
Joey: Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just standup straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so asRachel opens the door and startles him.)
Joey: I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
Joey: Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Joey: Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that Iwant to have dinner withyou tonight. Thats all.
Joey: Okay. Thats good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare whatyoure gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startlesJoey again.) Dont you people ever knock?!
Joey: What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason(Exhalesslowly)Is it hot in here?
Joey: I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvindoing Hobbs.
Joey: Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweaterout, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)
Joey: Uh How long have we known each other?
Joey: Uh-huh, long time.
Joey: But over the past few weeks
Joey: Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Joey: Im not quite sure.
Joey: Yeah, here we are. Uhh I I think Imfalling in lovewith you.
Joey: Im falling in love with you.
Joey: Does it really matter?
Joey: Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You dont have to say anything.You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay,you gotta say something!
Joey: But. (Hangs his head down.)
Joey: Yeah-yeah right. Thats okay. Thats fine. Thats uh,pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, its no big deal. All right? I thinkIm gonna go. (Stands up.)
Joey: Dont start doing that. You cant do that Rach, cause thenyoure gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next toher.)
Joey: Sure! 
Joey: Hey-hey-hey, hey! You cant. Okay? Ever!
Joey: Oh no-no Rach, please, dont be sorry. Okay? Dont be sorry.(They hug again.) Yknow I was only kidding you.
Joey: (hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! Thats Rachel!
Joey: No-no, I cant! I cant! Not after the other night, itsjust itstoo weird, okay? Dont tell her Im here! (Turns to run tothe bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Dont eat that! (Runsto the bathroom as Rachel enters.)
Joey: Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler)Dude, I dont know. Thats a pretty small hole.
Joey: I cant! Yknow? You guys dont know what its like toput yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
Joey: All right so, so what do I do?
Joey: Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.)Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Hi.
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Joey: So you uh, have abig work problem?
Joey: Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think Im gonna take off.
Joey: Yeah?
Joey: Yeah?
Joey: What?! Oh my-oh my God!
Joey: What he wants to buy your baby?!
Joey: Thats crazy!
Joey: Okay, how did this even happen?
Joey: Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figuredit was something about maternity leave.
Joey: Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guys not going to bebothering you about that baby thing anymore.
Joey: Lets just say I took care of it.
Joey: Dont worry! Dont worry. I just told him, very nicely,"You dont go buying peoples babies, so back off!!"
Joey: What?! Why?!
Joey: And you couldnt think of anything else?!
Joey: You lied to me!
Joey: So? What-what-what happened?
Joey: I know. I know.
Joey: Hey youre right. Yeah, its kinda been like us again a littlebit.
Joey: Me too. I mean Ihavent thought at all about how I put myselfout there and said all that stuff and how you didnt feel the same way about meand-and how it was really awkward.
Joey: So, whos the guy?
Joey: Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points tohimself) Im an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)
Joey: Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well Icant do it with you guys watching me!
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had astar named after them. 
Joey: And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
Joey: I have to go to the bathroom too, but I dont want him complimentingmy thing.
Joey: I know
Joey: Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We werebeing jerks. Parkers a nice guy and Id like to get to know him.
Joey: Why?
Joey: What-what? 
Joey: I know Im having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for thebuffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
Joey: I guess it couldve been, I didnt really look at it.Yknow, I just wiped it on Chandlers coat and got the hell out of there.
Joey: Oh hey, you should be excited about him. Theres nothing wrong withhim hes a good guy. 
Joey: Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
Joey: Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
Joey: Nothing
Joey: (reading) Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani.Thats me!! Im blank!!
Joey: Yeah you are baby.
Joey: No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me,but I said no.
Joey: Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said Iwrite a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall downthe elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
Joey: Fine! All right, Ill do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the nexttable so you can stop me if I yknow, start to say something stupid.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
Joey: (laughs) Actually, I didnt know the magazine was paying for it.Wouldnt have mattered, Im doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
Joey: And Ill have all the muffins.
Joey: (He goes into a song and dance number) 
Joey: Oh, you said it Mike. (Rips open the carton and spills milk on thecounter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Joey: (finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Startsto poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.
Joey: Yeah, I guess it is. And so Im gonna get on thisspaceship, (Smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, withflashing, colored lights on the side of it) and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in searchof alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone. ButI wont have aged at all. (Gets on the ladder) So you tell yourgreat-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne babyIm gonnawant to meet her. 
Joey: Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, Ican't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I doso I just watch 'emhave sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from TV) you know that's bad forthe paper tray.
Joey: Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy'sbutt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am
Joey: Well, there are so many things, its hard to pick just one.
Joey: (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because hes got abigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the wayjackass! (To Rachel) Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?

Joey: Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-itseverything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I wasreally nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts that I reallywanted. You always believed in me man.

Joey: (To God) Are you kidding me?!
Joey: I dont know! Maybe shes crazy! (Storms out.)
Joey: No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took herbreast out.
Joey: I didnt look at it. Stupid babys head was blocking most of it.
Joey: Look, its not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. Idont want to hurt her.
Joey: Youre right. Youre right. I-Ill go tell her now beforeRoss finds out and Ill be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by theway. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) ifyou want to check that out.

Joey: Oh thats right. Theres a lot going on here and I think I atesome bad fruit earlier.
Joey: I cant believe youre not going to propose!

Joey: (looking at the ceiling) Ah, its beautiful.
Joey: Yknow what you guys? Im uh, Im gonna go too. And uh,Im sorry about everything.
Joey: No, Rach, I shouldve told you sooner. Its just thatMan!That kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)

Joey: Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this(Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I dont really know what that means. (Ross justlooks at him) You were saying?
Joey: I know I shouldve. (Makes quote marks again.) "Imsorry." 
Joey: No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he cant leave) Look, Ross, wehave to get past this.
Joey: No, look, I dont know what else to do. I said Im sorry!
Joey: You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
Joey: Why not?  Youll feel better!  Ill feel better, andyou know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.

Joey: So?
Joey: Wow.
Joey: Really?
Joey: And youre Okay with that?
Joey: Hey, for what its worth, with Rachel I dont think youllever be just (Makes quote marks.) "anybody."

Joey: I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person  named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)
Joey: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with  Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship.  You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks  aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.
Joey: I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?

Joey: Mike, 'attorney at law'!
Joey: What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
Joey: Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to  Mike.
Joey: No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
Joey: Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out.  Mike hit my mom with a car.
Joey: That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're  friends again everything's great!
Joey: Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes  the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)
Joey: What?!
Joey: (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that  we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other.  We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch  you in the face for not being cool?!
Joey: What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.)  (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!
Joey: Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
Joey: Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like  this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!
Joey: (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?
Joey: Good night! 
Joey: (Walks In)
Joey: Look at this. My two best friends!
Joey: I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big  leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Joey: Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads  for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)
Joey: (On the phone with Chandler) Double promise? Call me  when you land.
Joey: Okay, bye. (He hangs up the phone.)
Joey: He had to board. 
Joey: Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell  whether she's hot or not, what do you think?
Joey: Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?
Joey: how come?
Joey: oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
Joey: oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through  teddy with the attached garters. (Nods)
Joey: didn't till just now.
Joey: hot not hot (she turns around) Hot!
Joey: I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed.
Joey: that would've been better, I'll try that Hi I'm Joey.
Joey: look I don't usually ask out women that I meet in  coffeehouses
Joey: (turns round) gesundheit
Joey: really, great, did I actually ask you?
Joey: (turns round again) seriously Gunther you should see  someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could DIE! (Gunther looks  scared)
Joey: yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that  last piece of cake at the restaurant.
Joey: do you have any cake?
Joey: (bends down to see and the cactus pricks him in the  ass) AWCH! That's why.
Joey: (enters) Hey
Joey: listen to this... I went out with this girl last night  and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
Joey: well that's not even the weird part. I don't think  she remembered sleeping with me.
Joey: yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am  very memorable, you guys know.
Joey: and who's fault is that.
Joey: HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes  when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN  MOST!
Joey: Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again  and try to get past it (reaches for the chips) OH SALT BLOATY!
Joey: What?
Joey: No. (Pause) wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
Joey: Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
Joey: How could you not remember that we slept together?
Joey: I dunno!
Joey: come on, come on, search your brain all right. it  was (thinks) a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had  sex (starts pointing out the places) here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
Joey: my god woman! How many people do you have to had been  with not to remember any of this?
Joey: Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember  me Hey! I still got it. (Turns back to Hayley) so were good. (She just glares  at him) I'll let myself out.
Joey: (looks at a girl walk in) see ordinarily I would talk  to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with  her?
Joey: your right! I love my life! (He gets up to go and  speak to the girl and he turns back and sits down) I actually did sleep with  her.
Joey: Thursday? But thats Halloween.
Joey: [Its just] So spooky, thats all.
Joey: I know, u-uch.
Joey: What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.
Joey: No, theyre comin, were waitin right here.
Phoebe &amp; Joey: Hey.
Joey: Maybe we should just eat now.
Joey: Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But theres still some food left on their place, okay, whats the restaurants policy about people eatin that?
Joey: But it happens? (waiter leaves) Im gotta go to the bathroom.
Joey: If you ask me to stay, Ill pee. (leaves)
Joey: (returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting now, sits) Finally you guys made it. (looks up, turns left to Phoebes chair) Pheebs, who the helluhuhh!
Joey: Thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) Waiter! lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails. (Hope, *I* kept up.)
Joey: Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as its ready? Appetizers, entrees, we dont care.
Joey: Thats a great storycan I eat it?
Joey: (mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
Joey: Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Joey: And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because 
Joey: Son of a bitch!
Joey: Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after the waiter)
Joey: (returned) No, no, its okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
Joey: Chandler, control your woman!
Joey: (to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you two?
Joey: So? Did have sex, right?
Joey: See ya. Well, this is just us.
Joey: Do, do you gonna do it now?
Joey: No-ohoh. (the Bings leave, the waiter comes)
Joey: Nah, just me. All alone. (all the food is served) Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
Joey: Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
Joey: Joey! Joey.
Joey: Thats the best birthday ever.
Joey: wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those  horses can crap. 
Joey: Oh my God!
Joey: Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I  can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. 
Joey: I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really  good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.  They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00  AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot. 
Joey: Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! &lt;motions her to  come over&gt; 
Joey: I.. I.. I need a good lie.
Joey: No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't  at a work thing today.
Joey: I do not.
Joey: Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a  raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said "Hey  don't eat that-that's Phoebe's" and he said.. &lt;pause&gt; He said.. "Joey  you stink at lying." What am I going to do? 
Joey: Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you. 
Joey: Uh.. &lt;forgetting what the work thing was, rolls  up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks&gt;
Joey: Oh.. man..
Joey: Pheebs, I still need some help here
Joey: Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..  I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor. 
Joey: Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?  Do you not trust me with a fancy plate? 
Joey: I can't believe I won.
Joey: Yeah he's lying. He looked down. 
Joey: I lie better then that, right?
Joey: Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because  I had a family emergency.
Joey: Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. &lt;throws hands  out in the air&gt;
Joey: Setting the table. 
Joey: ooh oooh.. 
Joey: What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello  on them. 
Joey: Actually its not pies, its just pie. 
Joey: Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had  a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie  Pheebs.
Joey: Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? (Chandler  walks back, looking angrily at Joey)
Joey: Uhm... (looks down) Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came  in...
Joey: (impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
Joey: I *love* my job.
Joey: Rach, these are for you.
Joey: No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Joey: Uh-huh.
Joey: And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Joey: They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
Joey: Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
Joey: Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
Joey: Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
Joey: Got ya. (blinks an eye)
Joey: Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Joey: Hey. So where's Mon?
Joey: And you're not helping?
Joey: You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
Joey: Yeah, you too.
Joey: How do you think she's doing?
Joey: Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
Joey: Sure.
Joey: Why not?
Joey: So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call   her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds   about right.
Joey: Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told   me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
Joey: Yes!
Joey: Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)
Joey: For a walk.
Joey: Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize   my thoughts.
Joey: Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta   see her!
Joey: Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me!   She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable   boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over   there?
Joey: Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the   world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Joey: Fine ... mediocre porn
Joey: Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
Joey: Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you   later (runs after Molly)
Joey: So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline.   It takes a lot of hard work.
Joey: Oh, I didn't go to college.
Joey: Molly ... people don't study acting ...
Joey: (upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??
Joey: No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair.   What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?   Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,   and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this   way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
Joey: Ok (admits)
Joey: It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The   princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
Joey: Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
Joey: On...?
Joey: Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
Joey: Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Joey: Hey hey! You dye your hair!
Joey: Arghhh! Double standards!
Joey: Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
Joey: Chandler Bing.
Joey: OK Thanks.(Joey touches the hot wax). I touched the stuff
Joey: Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
Joey: Oh good...
Joey: All right let's just do this.
Joey: Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK(He tries to avoid the tweezers) Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!
Joey: Hey, I need your help.
Joey: Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped
Joey: You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don’t match!
Joey: All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don’t look stupid for my pictures.
Joey: What the hell am I supposed to do!
Joey: What, what.
Joey: Oh my God!
Joey: Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don’t know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so bad!
Joey: Oh my God! I didn’t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon
Joey: Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
Joey: Thank you so much.
Joey: Listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
Joey: Comb my eyelashes.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Ha, oh, of course.
Joey: Your eyebrows look weird.
Joey: Morning, roomie!
Joey: Fifth day's a charm.
Joey: Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want,      and when does she stop crying all night?
Joey: She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did      last night.
Joey: No, hey, it's been great.
Joey: Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying      here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?      And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using      a breast pump...
Joey: Wow! So, how are you?
Joey: Really?
Joey: Well, actually it...
Joey: Wow, really?
Joey: Sure, I know lots of girls. 
Joey: Ooh, names?
Joey: Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
Joey: I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with      her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
Joey: Why are they doing this?
Joey: You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in      here?
Joey: I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know,      that's where things were headed.
Joey: Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have      kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
Joey: Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck!      But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.
Joey: I know; that just pushes them further and further apart. 
Joey: Ooh, that's a great plan! 
Joey: Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
Joey: Hey.
Joey: All right! Who is he?
Joey: She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher! 
Joey: Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh,      oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
Joey: Oh my god, you're right! 
Joey: She even reads for pleasure!
Joey: What? I'm not allowed to know smart women? 
Joey: I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Joey: Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,      and find him somebody else.
Joey: Ooh...I hear that's bad. 
Joey: Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like      Santa Claus.)
Joey: Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
Joey: Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
Joey: Hello?
Joey: Emma? Hey! Hi!
Joey: How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the      bedroom door closed?
Joey: You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
Joey: Because you two were having sex!
Joey: Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.)      You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
Joey: Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in      the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this. 
Joey: Hey, I gotta! Unless...
Joey: Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
Joey: Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family      name.
Joey: (BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.
Joey: Uh-huh.
Joey: It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
Joey: We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really      bonding.
Joey: Where?
Joey: Can you believe they're still not here?
Joey: I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?
Joey: We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is  my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong.
Joey: Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always  a mistake.
Joey: And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Joey: Oh...how much?
Joey: Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Joey: That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it. Rachel enters)
Joey: Oo...what's in the bag?
Joey: Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when  I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or  er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
Joey: You're gonna do it?
Joey: Oh, women can. You can't.
Joey: The hardware store is right down the street.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Joey: Yeah, I know.
Joey: Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and  the economy is bad.
Joey: (to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Joey: Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Joey: Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your  rent is. (shrugs)
Joey: (To himself) I am on fire!
Joey: Err... Kind of.
Joey: Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems,  it was for something for her.
Joey: Something personal.
Joey: Boob job.
Joey: Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would  be crazy.
Joey: Rach?! (He walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened  either) Rachel!!!!? (He walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet  seat cover. It won't come up.) So I can't do anything I like????
Joey: Because she is!
Joey: Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
Joey: OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any  bigger?
Joey: Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
Joey: (voice strained) Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Joey: AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... (He takes a box out, about to close  fridge, then thinks.) Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able  to get in here again!
Joey: Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!
Joey: Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)
Joey: (he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
Joey: Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)
Joey: (after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)
Joey: Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Joey: Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)
Joey: (still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
Joey: Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount... 
Joey: Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
Joey: Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...  with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)
Joey: It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
Joey: Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
Joey: (placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie...  (to Emma) This isn't over.
Joey: Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
Joey: No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!
Joey: No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
Joey: Make the transfer! (She does so)
Joey: Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
Joey: But he's the same.
Joey: But he's the same.
Joey: He's the same!
Joey: (to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!
Joey: Original or crappy?
Joey: No, sorry haven't seen him.
Joey: It's Monica, ok?
Joey: Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
Joey: ... she's being unreasonable!
Joey: It does?
Joey: Really? She... she loves me?
Joey: Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him.
Joey: Look forget it forget it...  I can't do it.
Joey: How do you think I got him in the first place?
Joey: Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
Joey: Alright!
Joey: (abashed) A place to entertain my lady friends.
Joey: (even more abashed) A place to eat spaghetti.
Joey: Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million andthey don't sell tickets here in New York, so...
Joey: (hesitates for a moment)Yeah Connecticut...Not WestVirginia.
Joey: Uh!
Joey: Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
Joey: I like those odds!
Joey: (who wasn't paying attention)What's that now?
Joey: (sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma!And Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who hasEmma!?
Joey: (not yelling anymore)I was?
Joey: I did?
Joey: Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
Joey: Ooh! Tough odds!
Joey: (smiling)Look who's coming around!
Joey: (excited)Did you get it?
Joey: (Still excited)By you!?
Joey: I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
Joey: I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...youknow...won't come true!
Joey: Can't really say!
Joey: (slightly irritated)I'm not really comfortable withthese questions!
Joey: I won, hey!
Joey: Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? 
Joey: Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buythe Knicks!
Joey: Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
Joey: You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believeyou're taking this away from me!
Joey: Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
Joey: I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut,when did you even get those?
Joey: (to Ross) I'll show you how.
Joey: Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl fromRachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
Joey: Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me!This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)
Joey: (in pain) Oh!
Joey: No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they getjammed in the window)
Joey: (sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on!They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myselfchanging.
Joey: And what did she say?
Joey: (checking the last ticket) Damnit! anybody got anything?
Joey: (to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job. 
Joey: And I like to think I had a little something to do withit.
Joey: Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish wewould win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.
Joey: Oh yeah.
Joey: Me too.
Joey: (sitting in a chair) Hey guys, so I just called thePowerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
Joey: (talking to a pineapple in his hand) God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
Joey: I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
Joey: Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
Joey: Yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?
Joey: Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
Joey: Right!(he starts to ape her)"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)
Joey: I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
Joey: Also so gay!
Joey: Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
Joey: Oh, wish me luck!
Joey: Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
Joey: Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
Joey: Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
Joey: Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
Joey: What?
Joey: Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
Joey: but, but..
Joey: Hey!
Joey: (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!
Joey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? 
Joey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very! 
Joey: What?
Joey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
Joey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
Joey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
Joey: So...I've never played that!
Joey: Uh...well...just once...with you...
Joey: (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??
Joey: (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
Joey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
Joey: (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)
Joey: (enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
Joey: Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
Joey: It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".
Joey: You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
Joey: I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
Joey: (lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go.
Joey: (entering the room) Hey!
Joey: What's happenin'?
Joey: Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
Joey: (yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!
Joey: Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
Joey: I do it every year.
Joey: I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
Joey: Yeah...
Joey: Yeah...
Joey: (Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!
Joey: You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
Joey: (speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
Joey: Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
Joey: (sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
Joey: What party?
Joey: (looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...
Joey: (to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)
Joey: (To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming.
Joey: Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
Joey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)
Joey: It's a science.
Joey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
Joey: Monica!
Joey: (To Rachel) What have you got there?
Joey: Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
Joey: (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.
Joey: (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
Joey: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
Joey: That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
Joey: Me.
Joey: Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
Joey: Gotcha.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious   (which, being Joey, he mispronounces "amonious"). (pause) That's not   how she used it...?
Joey: Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious.   No? Am I getting close?
Joey: (sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost   more than milk!
Joey: Heeey!
Joey: Come on in, how are ya?
Joey: Can I offer you a drink?
Joey: Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to   open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!
Joey: Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)
Joey: Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
Joey: (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!
Joey: I know, yeah!
Joey: Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna   see the Yankees.
Joey: Which one, they all suck!
Joey: (looking puzzled) I don't think so.
Joey: Ross!
Joey: I need to talk to you about Charlie.
Joey: Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
Joey: No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her   body is soo...
Joey: Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've   ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
Joey: (checking) EH, what do you know!
Joey: Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural   places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
Joey: Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really   like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
Joey: Thanks.
Joey: The Metsss!
Joey: (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're   gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum,   and avoid all the confusion!
Joey: Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
Joey: Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too   fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
Joey: You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make   the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the   right and Joey nods)
Joey: (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly   lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors   as his elusive subject was light itself.
Joey: (shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth   says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Joey: Phonetically? (Looks confused)
Joey: Ok.
Joey: Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"   I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Joey: No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I   guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
Joey: Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish   of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the   imaginary painting).
Joey: Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
Joey: Hey!
Joey: (to Charlie) You're ready?
Joey: (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me   up.
Joey: Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna   be, but... (confidently) I made it work.
Joey: So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Joey: Oh hey Rach!
Joey: Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Joey: Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
Joey: (to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
Joey: What's the matter, Pheebs?
Joey: Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Joey: Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
Joey: (to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)
Joey: Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
Joey: Bye.
Joey: All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
Joey: So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Joey: So, I don't have to learn what that means?
Joey: Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
Joey: Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
Joey: Hello?
Joey: No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Joey: Oh! How's it going?
Joey: What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Joey: Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
Joey: Well, just wake him up!
Joey: Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
Joey: (impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
Joey: Then don't go!
Joey: Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
Joey: (entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
Joey: Mmh-mmh.
Joey: Barbados!
Joey: All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
Joey: I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)
Joey: (to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
Joey: That... never happens...
Joey: No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".
Joey: (thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
Joey: You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
Joey: Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
Joey: Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
Joey: You really should have been more clear about that!
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
Joey: You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?" (looks at Ross matter-of-factly)
Joey: Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
Joey: (smiling) Will you wear a thong?
Joey: Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Joey: Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
Joey: No, why?
Joey: Oh man!
Joey: I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)
Joey: Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Joey: Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
Joey: Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)
Joey: Hey guys!
Joey: Damnit!
Joey: Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh! Secret teapot?
Joey: It's really gone?
Joey: I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Joey: Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
Joey: Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave).
Joey: I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
Joey: Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
Joey: (stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
Joey: Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
Joey: (walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba...
Joey: Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)
Joey: In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)
Joey: Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
Joey: Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
Joey: But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
Joey: There it is, you're blushing!
Joey: You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little)
Joey: Tell me who it is.
Joey: Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
Joey: What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
Joey: (eagerly) Yeah, who is that?
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Joey: Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
Joey: Yeah. (they leave)
Joey: Night.
Joey: He said "erectus"!
Joey: No, he really said it.
Joey: Erectus?
Joey: Yeah, and so funny!
Joey: Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)
Joey: (disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
Joey: (interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)
Joey: (bewildered) Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
Joey: Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
Joey: Yeah... I think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?
Joey: (downhearted) Hey...
Joey: Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Joey: Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
Joey: No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
Joey: I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
Joey: (laughing sarcastically) Ok, Rach!
Joey: I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
Joey: Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... (sighs) What the hell is my problem? OH! (He falls back on the bed)
Joey: (sitting up again) I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
Joey: But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look)
Joey: (stands up) No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
Joey: Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
Joey: You like me? (shuts the door)
Joey: (shocked) That's a huge thing!
Joey: What... for how long?
Joey: (outraged) A MONTH??
Joey: (stands up) I just have one question!
Joey: (desperate) What the hell are you doin'???
Joey: Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
Joey: CURIOUS GEORGE (see link)! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
Joey: Yeah, he had a paper route.
Joey: No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
Joey: (charmed, but then recoiling) NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
Joey: Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! (sighs) I couldn't do it to Ross!
Joey: I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... (painfully) I'm sorry...!
Joey: NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
Joey: NO BIG DEAL!
Joey: Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
Joey: Yeah. It's actually our first official date 
Joey: Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
Joey: (pause) It's OK!
Joey: Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
Joey: No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have  to appreciate their uniqueness.
Joey: No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes.  Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
Joey: NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts  lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)
Joey: More foosball?
Joey: I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems  puzzled) Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of  the couch?
Joey: What’s the matter?
Joey: I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!
Joey: Ok.
Joey: (a little giddy) Uh, was that good for you?
Joey: Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
Joey: Ok, yeah, got it.
Rachel and Joey: Okay.
Joey: This thing welded shut?!
Joey: All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this  thing.
Joey: Sorry!
Joey: I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me  before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can  do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!  I blame your bra!
Joey: Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me  off with all your slapping!
Joey: (contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said)  NAH! I don't have another level!! 
Joey: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points  to the hall).
Joey: (To Rachel) Hey!
Joey: Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
Joey: Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him) 
Joey: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
Joey: Oh! yeah!
Joey: uh uh!
Joey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
Joey: (He just sits there, legs very close together with  a painful look on his face) Soldier down!
Joey: Well, I know what's the matter with me.
Joey: I don't know.
Joey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it  was... really wrong?
Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's  difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Joey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...  do it.
Joey: That's a... pla-an.
Joey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.
Rachel: I know.Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what  I wanted. 
Joey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
Joey: So...
Joey: I love ya.
Joey: Yeah, me too.
Joey: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
Joey: Hey!
Joey: 18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his "How You Doin'"   line)Ross: Joey, NO!
Joey: What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
Joey: And starting to think about settling down!
Joey: I'd love to! Yeah! Joey: (To Phoebe) We were supposed to bring presents?
Joey: Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?
Joey: Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed   for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as   a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"!   (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup!
Joey: Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
Joey: Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what   would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
Joey: Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song,   maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!Phoebe: So you’re gonna... hit on her?
Joey: No, no, no! My talents as an actor!
Joey: You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one   of her books!
Joey: Hey, I think Emma might like it!
Joey: Um, my present!
Joey: Actually we prepared performances.
Joey: But equally real!
Joey: (unconfidently) O K.
Joey: Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole   crew waiting!
Joey: I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.
Joey: Uh, why, it’s a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh,   (he reads the title of the book) “Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum   depression” eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) “Love   you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly   books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico.   A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and   forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love   you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby   you’ll be”. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book).   And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll   like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.
Joey: I'm so confused!
Joey: Got it! (Goes towards the front door  and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where do you think you're going? 
Joey: Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna   be here for a li...(stops and thinks) Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
Joey: Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
Joey: No.
Joey: Ok! (Opens the door for them) 
Joey: Nighty-night!
Joey: Bye, bye.
Joey: Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he   fought for our country.
Joey: (Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you   guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)
Joey: Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
Joey: Hello?
Joey: Hey! (smiles)
Joey: (smile fades) What audition?
Joey: What? You never said anything about an audition!
Joey: A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for   his "dramatic reading") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room)   Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
Joey: Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever   gets the highest number gets to go first.
Joey: Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
Joey: Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
Joey: Right.
Joey: Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)
Joey: Come on robot!
Joey: Way to go robot!
Joey: Hey, good race you guys.
Joey: Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE   TIME!
Joey: (to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!
Joey: What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it   was a penis.
Joey: Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
Joey: No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from   a can!
Joey: U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
Joey: Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
Joey: I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how   much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
Joey: Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby   adoption decider people..."
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
Joey: That's right, yeah.
Joey: Always nice to meet a fan!
Joey: I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Joey: (using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it   to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Joey: What did I just say?
Joey: Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus)   "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey   Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
Joey: Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to   Chandler) Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the   longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
Joey: (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated   for ya?
Joey: Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!
Joey: Yep!
Joey: Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.
Joey: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
Joey: Why not?
Joey: Ah, look who’s back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH,   WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
Joey: What?
Joey: You slept out here?
Joey: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re   getting rid of her.
Joey: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping   Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"   I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!
Joey: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?
Joey: Yeah, Monica made us!
Joey: Yeaah.
Joey: (yelling at her) I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
Joey: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to   hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)
Joey: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at  all! See ya later! (Leaves)
Joey: (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani...   Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home   right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was   nice!
Joey: Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room)
Joey: (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!
Joey: Hey!Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!
Joey: Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe)   Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and...   (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!
Joey: (Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back.   Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!
Joey: No.
Joey: Cool!
Joey: That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
Joey: What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon!   Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired!   (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh??   Come on! What can't I do?
Joey: I can do that! (in a deeper voice) "Hello, I'm   your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing.   I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
Joey: (after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!
Joey: Oh! Any word on casting yet?
Joey: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor   you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
Joey: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't   pass it on to your bosses!
Joey: Thank you. (he sits down)
Joey: Damn it! (he leaves)
Joey: Just pass it to your boss!
Joey: What's up?
Joey: (sounds disappointed) Oh.
Joey: (looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched   the tape?
Joey: (sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape.
Joey: Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
Joey: Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room   and is observing the conversation)
Joey: Keep going Pinocchio!
Joey: (yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards   his room)
Joey: You still here?
Joey: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok?   First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about   lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying   about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in   the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!
Joey: (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?   (goes back into his room) 
Joey: (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't   watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this   tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I   got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play   and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)
Joey: (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you   didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door). 
Joey: (enters from his bedroom) What?
Joey: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very   reasonable price.
Joey: But it's an original Buffay...
Joey: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
Joey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Joey: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you   lied.
Joey: Now, what do you say?
Joey: And?... AND?
Joey: Gladys?
Joey: You're mean!
Joey: Hey!
Joey: What's going on?
Joey: Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Joey: Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very   impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
Joey: (pointing at himself) Celebrity.
Joey: (going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I guess we'll never know whose   it is!
Joey: (form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?     (He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs to the door and shuts it   back in   his face) OW!
Joey: Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
Joey: Guys!?
Joey: What's going on?
Joey: Everything doesn't sound fine!
Joey: Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
Joey: But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
Joey: We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word   for danger.
Joey: (quivering with anger) I did not care for that!
Joey: Ok, ok! (He leaves)
Joey: I forgot my bat.
Joey: (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
Joey: Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back   here. I can't believe you never called me.
Joey: Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by   the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...   lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
Joey: No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of...   social work, ok, that you can just... do.
Joey: Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny,   we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
Joey: No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You   know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the   apartment, leaving her shocked)
Joey: (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes   the door behind him)
Joey: LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)
Joey: Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
Joey: I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
Joey: But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
Joey: I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. (the girl leaves and Phoebe goes toward the couch) (to Phoebe) Hey!
Joey: So... who's your friend?
Joey: OW, why, why, why?
Joey: Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
Joey: Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
Joey: I know why I don't remember her, huh? (he winks at Rachel)
Joey: Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
Joey: (pointing at himself) Growth!
Joey: Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. (he starts writing on his hand) Mandy.
Joey: Saraaah.
Joey: I can see why, nice shirt!
Joey: Stupid Gap on every corner!
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Well...
Joey: Nope.
Joey: Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere... 
Joey: Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.
Joey: ALL FOOD!
Joey: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!
Joey: (mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!
Joey: (he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) What were we talking about?
Joey: I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Joey: (now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Joey: (looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Joey: Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
Joey: oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. (Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries)
Joey: Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
Joey: How about those fries though, huh? (Holds the plate between Sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his)
Joey: (Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) You are beautiful, you know that?
Joey: Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back)
Joey: (Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!!
Joey: I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
Joey: WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
Joey: I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it). 
Joey: I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
Joey: (Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams.
Joey: Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
Joey: (More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to    be healthy. (pushes it aside)
Joey: Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
Joey: Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
Joey: Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule?
Joey: (laughing) Really?
Joey: Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs uneasily and Sarah leaves the room)
Joey: (to the torte) Stop staring at me!
Joey: Why, just a tiny little...
Joey: Oh-oh!
Joey: I'm not even sorry.
Joey: (nods) So, why are you still wearing it?
Joey: Ooh... Not so good.
Joey: Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
Joey: (shouting to Ross) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
Joey: Hey, great! All right!
Joey: What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing,   okay? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to   Monica and Chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid   suburbs...
Joey: Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Joey: No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
Joey: Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. (He walks out, and   Rachel follows him)
Joey: Hey Phoebe.
Joey: I’m just mad at my agent.
Joey: There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I   didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.
 Joey: Well (taking his cell phone out of a pocket) I’m wanna hear it,   because she keeps doing this.
Joey: Ok. Why?
Joey: I love that saying!
Joey: Hello?
Joey: I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.
Joey: Yeah, actually I am!
Joey: That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
Joey: No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok?   And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.
Joey: I’m saying that… (pause). This isn't  working for me   anymore, ok? Estelle, you’re fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone).
Joey: Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be   killing her.
Joey: I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like   her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing   he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but   she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.
Joey: Why?
Joey: (impressed) You blow me away. 
Joey: I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. (Phoebe stops   herself from laughing and leaves)
Joey: Oh my God. (Still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) Hello?
Joey: Estelle?
Joey: (still scared) Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
Joey: No, no, no! (Starts looking around the room, terrified) Don't drop by,   don't drop by!
Joey: Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
Joey: Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. (Hangs up and reads the phone display)   "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
Joey: Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects   to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... (Joey looks at the photograph)   ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. (Joey   looks for his notes. The man next to him is chewing something.) Dude, where's   my speech? (the man swallows something and looks at Joey.) That is   entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. (he applauds and Al shows that there's   nothing left in his mouth.)
