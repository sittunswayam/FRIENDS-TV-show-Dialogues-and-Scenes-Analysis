Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?
Monica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved herstuff out today. 
Monica: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.

Monica: Oh really, so thathysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never havegrandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number?

Monica: Well, I guess we've established who'sstaying here with Monica...
Monica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just tryto think of nice calm things...

Monica: Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!

Monica: What for?
Monica: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida? 
Monica: How do you do that?
Monica: You know Paul? 
Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul? 
Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? 
Monica: I hate men!  I hate men!
Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort ofbeacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? 
Monica: I just thought he was nice, y'know? 
Monica: How'd you pay for them? 
Monica: And who pays for that? 
Monica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. 
Monica: All right, you ready?
Monica: You can, I know youcan! 
Monica:  Rachel! That was a library card! 
Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You'regonna love it! 
Monica: Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch? 
Monica: You be okay? 
Monica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy.Alright. Goodnight, everybody. 
Monica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you? 
Monica: What? I-I said you had a- 
Monica: (to Phoebe) Would you stop? 
Monica: I said that you had a nicebutt, it's just not a great butt.
Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us,kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunitionthan they already have. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Monica: What? 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Monica: You didn't. 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom ofthe glass pan.) 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Monica: Curry. 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were youplanning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take someof the heat off me. 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Monica: No it's not. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going onwith you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes toshare with the folks? 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if youcould- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Monica: No. 
Monica: Am not! 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up! 
Monica: Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You willnever see me naked'. 
Monica: Uh, Ross. 
Monica: No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of aguy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. 
Monica: What did they do to you? 
Monica: We're with you. We got it. 
Monica: (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing? 
Monica: Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date. 
Monica: 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. 
Monica: Let's see, today's Monday... Never. 
Monica: No. Not after what happened with Steve. 
Monica: Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chanceto figure that out. 
Monica: Nope. Schhorry. 
Monica: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, andwithin five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off theweak members of the herd. 
Monica: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actuallyliked. 
Monica: Do you all promise? 
Monica: (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good? 
Monica: Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it? 
Monica: (to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much youall like me. 
Monica: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. 
Monica: (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay.Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? 
Monica: C'mon! 
Monica: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going outwith? 
Monica: Really! 
Monica: Hi.. how was the game? 
Monica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? 
Monica: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe..sometimes.. 
Monica: ..I dunno, a little too Alan? 
Monica: Oh, why is it unfair? 
Monica: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 
Monica: Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. 
Monica: Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing.I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing. 
Monica: I know.. it's gonna be really hard. 
Monica: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. 
Monica: (entering) Hey. Where's Joey? 
Monica: Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.) 
Monica: Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. 
Monica: (turns off the TV) Okay.. 
Monica: Please, guys, we have to talk. 
Monica: Alright, we have to talk. 
Monica: Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. Imean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. 
Monica: No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change. 
Monica: Look, I- I could go on pretending- 
Monica: -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- Itwouldn't be fair to you! 
Monica: I'm sorry.. 
Monica: I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. 
Monica: Are you guys gonna be okay? 
Monica: (dubious) I understand. 
Monica: I'm, I'm really sorry. 
Monica: Relieved? 
Monica: (entering) Hi. 
Monica: Oh, y'know.. 
Monica: He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look) 
Monica: Alright. Phoebe? 
Monica: Hey, Joey, what would you do if you wereomnipotent? 
Monica: ..Excuse me? 
Monica: How does she do that? 
Monica: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
Monica: What's going on with you? 
Monica: Well, if you want, you can stay with Racheland me tonight. 
Monica: Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. 
Monica: Wow, you worked in a mine? 
Monica: Yeah, yeah. 
Monica: (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do thison Wild Kingdom. 
Monica: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours thecontents of the blender into some glasses.) 
Monica: Weeeell, it's rum, and- 
Monica: We thought since Phoebe was staying overtonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we gotcookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) 
Monica: Uh, Rach, it's the Visa cardpeople. 
Monica: (on phone) Could you please tell me whatthis is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's beensome unusual activity on your account. 
Monica: That is the unusualactivity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. 
Monica: (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel hasleft the building, can you call back? 
Monica: You should feel great about yourself! You'redoing this amazing independence thing! 
Monica: Ah, the other Jack. 
Monica: So what, you're not the only one. I mean,half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it'sall gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. 
Monica: ...Pheebs? 
Monica: No, you were right. I don't have a plan.(There's a knock on the door.) 
Monica: Phoebe? 
Monica: Do you have a plan? 
Monica: (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' 
Monica: Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guywith curiously intelligent good looks? 
Monica: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
Monica: (staggered) Oh God. 
Monica: Are you nuts?! We've got GeorgeStephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to thewindow.) 
Monica: I see pizza! 
Monica: White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? 
Monica: Please tell me it's his mother. 
Monica: Oh, no... 
Monica: Light still out? 
Monica: Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
Monica: I think he's shy. 
Monica: Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. Andthen- when you do- he's a preppy animal. 
Monica: Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember thatvegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? 
Monica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...hahaaaah! 
Monica: What?! You slept with Jason? 
Monica: Oh, that's nice! 
Monica: Excuse me?! 
Monica: Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't peein their pants in seventh grade! 
Monica: Where? 
Monica: Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! 
Ross: (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right footred. 
Monica: Could've played Monopoly, butnooooo. 
Monica: Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Monica: Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Monica: Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Monica: Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thingagain?
Monica: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Monica: Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Monica: (looking out window) Oh, god help us.
Monica: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Monica: What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Monica: Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Monica: Which?
Monica: You've never met Bob, have you?
Monica: Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Monica: ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Monica: (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys growup?
Monica: How, how did that happen?
Monica: What?
Monica: I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Monica: It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has anemotional age beyond, like eight.
Monica: Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Monica: Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head toinflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm justthinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, couldwe check it in the light, please? 
Monica: Oh my god.
Monica: Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Monica: Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Monica: Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, isit?
Monica: Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Monica: (hits him lightly) Oh! 
Monica: (leaving) I'm outta here.
Monica: Really?
Monica: I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughingat your Norman Mailer story.
Monica: Hi.
Monica: We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Monica: (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry.
Monica: Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body,to have something else to do?
Monica: Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Monica: You could do that!
Monica: Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Monica: Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Monica: Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could youget involved with a woman like this?
Monica: What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going outwith someone else?
Monica: Good for you, Joey.
Monica: We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Monica: ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Monica: How-how did that happen?
Monica: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's seewhat it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see.Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Monica: You guys, I am not that bad!
Monica: That is so unfair!
Monica: Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Monica: Why not?
Monica: I could do that.
Monica: Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Monica: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Monica: Well, what's the part?
Monica: (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.
Monica: Alright, alright, alright... 
Monica: For what?
Monica: Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don'tever tell me what you did in there.
Monica: He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Monica: I warned you...
Monica: Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Monica: Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remindyou to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. 
Monica: Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new AlPacino movie?
Monica: Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Monica: I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. 
Monica: (determined) Uh-huh!
Monica: Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to herroom.)
Monica: (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers youthat much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't haveto prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them,and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her headin her pillow.) 
Monica: Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and theyhave no idea when it's coming back on.
Monica: (into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in ablackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangsup)
Monica: Hello?
Monica: (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
Monica: What?
Monica: I have no idea what you just said.
Monica: OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Monica: Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Monica: You did not go!
Monica: Outside.
Monica: Why not?
Monica: And that would be?
Monica: Joey, what's going on?
Monica: About what?
Monica: Oh my God! I love him!
Monica: My surprise party!
Monica: Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Monica: No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Monica: (to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Monica: (smitten) Hi!
Monica: Hi!
Monica: Hi!
Monica: If you want, I'll do it.
Monica: I did.
Monica: Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Monica: Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. 
Monica: Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
Monica: How-how are you, Mom?
Monica: What?
Monica: Nothing.
Monica: She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Monica: Oh God!
Monica: The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. 
Monica: I know.
Monica: G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)
Monica: Ross!
Monica: We checked. A lot.
Monica: Dad!
Monica: You what?
Monica: Define fun.
Monica: ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Monica: That's probably what they'll say.
Monica: Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Didyou know my ears are not my best feature?
Monica: Are these the shoes?
Monica: It was a really beautiful service.
Monica: Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Monica: Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Monica: That sounds like Nana.
Monica: ...I can imagine.
Monica: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it allover again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Monica: How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like yourhair... for example.
Monica: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her thetruth?
Monica: Huh.
Monica: Oh, I think so.
Monica: Thank you. They're yours.
Monica: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and thegang at Java Joe's'. 
Monica: Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Monica: Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico forThanksgiving?
Monica: Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Monica: I am not wrong.
Monica: No, I just talked to them.
Monica: Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthyguys"?
Monica: Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll makeit just like Mom's.
Monica: You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at hersheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Monica: And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrimholidays.
Monica: Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Monica: So you're free Thursday, then.
Monica: Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Monica: Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Monica: Rach, here's your mail.
Monica: (insistently) No, here's your mail.
Monica: (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
Monica: We all chipped in.
Monica: (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.
Monica: (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditionalThanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your familysize bag of Funyuns.
Monica: Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams areyamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?
Monica: All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stopmoping.
Monica: That's not a question.
Monica: All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, andin the form of tots.
Monica: Ah!
Monica: What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Monica: Why would we do that?
Monica: Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Monica: Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Monica: Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy onthe inside. Why are we standing here?
Monica: No I don't.
Monica: No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Monica: (panicked) The oven is on.
Monica: Well then get it, get it!
Monica: (angry) Joey!
Monica: Can you go any faster with that?
Monica: Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Monica: I swear you said you had the keys.
Monica: Why would I have the keys?
Monica: But I didn't.
Monica: Why?
Monica: Why?
Monica: Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'mmaking Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind ofpotatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind ofpotatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peasand onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned,and, and I... I...
Monica: Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoesare ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Monica: No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the panof badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Monica: Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this deliciousThanksgiving dinner?
Monica: Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Monica: Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
Monica: (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Monica: Make a wish?
Monica: W-wait. What is that?
Monica: No, no, I don't.
Monica: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Monica: Why don't you just get a roommate?
Monica: So, how'd it go?
Monica: So what are you gonna be?
Monica: I think it's romantic.
Monica: What?!
Monica: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Monica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Monica: Do you always have to bring him here?
Monica: I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe hassomebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: What's the matter?
Monica: Vividly.
Monica: Hi.
Monica: That thing is not coming in here.
Monica: I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Monica: Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Monica: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Monica: Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Monica: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Monica: So I'm kissing everyone?
Monica: Why?
Monica: Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, butbehind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit ofdepression. 
Monica: He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Monica: We are not going to whistle.
Monica: No!
Monica: No!
Monica: (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!
Monica: Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-thathe'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Monica: Phoebe, what are you doing?
Monica: I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, evensleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Monica: Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he candance!
Monica: I wish all guys could be like him.
Monica: He doesn't have anyone.
Monica: Last night.
Monica: Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... themayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teamsplayed sports.
Monica: Nah... not-not special enough.
Monica: Waaay too special.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: (Entering) What are you guys doing here?
Monica: ...What did I ask?
Monica: Hi.
Monica: What are you doing here?
Monica: I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. myway... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Monica: How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Monica: Hey.
Monica: (Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'. 
Monica: (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Monica: Hello. 
Monica: No, you?
Monica: You just asked me.
Monica: Oh! You're awake!
Monica: You look good!
Monica: Oh, sorry.
Monica: I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Monica: I got you the foot massager.
Monica: I read to you.
Monica: Oh, my pleasure.
Monica: "See you around?"
Monica: Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit somethingto me? "I'll call you?" 
Monica: This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then-we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "Seeyou around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Monica: What's a 'niffle'?
Monica: Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had toldme vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person onphone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Monica: Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want meto do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, AuntSyl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Monica: So, did I hear Poconos?
Monica: Yeah, that's a big step.
Monica: And Monica knows...
Monica: Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Monica: I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Monica: Phoebe, what's the matter?
Monica: Phoebe, what is it?
Monica: Well, what happened?
Monica: Are you sure?
Monica: Was it...?
Monica: Oh!
Monica: So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these littleguys' heads?
Monica: Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points atChandler) You suck!
Monica: We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switchingplaces with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game!Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)
Monica: Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony,now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands infront of her chest), Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormousbreasts!" Here he comes! 
Monica: Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him alasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Monica: Oh, you're right.
Monica: Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Monica: Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Monica: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Monica: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only usemy left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, Igotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.
Monica: So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Monica: Hey, how long are you in the city?
Monica: Hello?
Monica: C'mon up.
Monica: Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Monica: Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Monica: Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe whatyou were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Monica: You're welcome.
Monica: Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)
Monica: Hi...May I help you?
Monica: Okay...who are you?
Monica: Oh, c'mon in.
Monica: How's it going?
Monica: Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. 
Monica: So you talked to your dad, huh.
Monica: How's it going?
Monica: Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Monica: Hello, Joey.
Monica: You can not do this.
Monica: Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Monica: But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. Iknow I do. 
Monica: Which one was Pete Carney?
Monica: Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day overHoward-the-"I-win"-guy. (imitating) "I win! I win!" I went out withthe guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Monica: I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Monica: There's more beer, right?
Monica: Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Monica: Burning's good.
Monica: Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Monica: Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Monica: Rach, come see who's out here!
Monica: I'll be right back.
Monica: Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (toChandler) He just happened to call.
Monica: All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Monica: Can we just start throwing things in?
Monica: Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Monica: No.
Monica: Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
Monica: You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
Monica: They're nice guys.
Monica: Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?
Monica: Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Monica: Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Monica: (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.
Monica: Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Monica: (excited) Oh my God!
Monica: Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Monica: So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this,it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Monica: So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind oflike an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for mebecause then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Monica: I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Monica: (to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse.
Monica: Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Monica: Yeah, well, is that better?
Monica: (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'llcheer you up.
Monica: It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call itan amouz-bouche. 
Monica: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock.(Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) Allright, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)
Monica: Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Monica: Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Monica: But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know?And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Monica: (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised!Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)
Monica: Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Monica: Ten dollars an hour.
Monica: Twelve dollars an hour.
Monica: You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it,desperate) twenty dollars an hour.
Monica: Hi Steve!
Monica: (to Steve) This is Rachel.
Monica: Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Monica: Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monicabrings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce...(Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (hefinishes)... ginger.
Monica: I'm so glad you liked them!
Monica: Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and ahalf minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Monica: (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't wantto spoil your appetite.
Monica: You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Monica: No, we don't. (reaches for box) 
Monica: Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then triesto secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Monica: Give them to me.
Monica: No, give me the...
Monica: (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!
Monica: What?
Monica: Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity likethis, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Monica: I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Monica: Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
Monica: Ross, thats my jacket.
Monica: Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Monica: Great.
Monica: Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around NewYears... but obviously someone forgot.
Monica: I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl shedoesnt have a job yet?
Monica: Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnestargument.
Monica: Ill get it.
Monica: Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
Monica: Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking,quietly.
Monica: (Closing the door) Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Monica: Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Monica: (Remotely turning off the television) okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Monica: Are you alright?
Monica: Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Monica: Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you comeback inside?
Monica: Oh-my-god Rachel! (Rushing out to look over the edge) Rachel!
Monica: (as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to getmarried, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Monica: (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey,that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?
Monica: (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Monica: (as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.
Monica: (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We bothdo that!
Monica: (as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further awayfrom Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um...there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Monica: (as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachelcan catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Monica: (taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles atRachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thankyou. (Hangs up)
Monica: (as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing asignature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one(little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'causeum...
Monica: (as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)
Monica: (as Rachel) Monica.
Monica: (as Rachel) Hi.
Monica: Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
Monica: Hey, guys.
Monica: Lots of responses.
Monica: (reading): OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. (crumpesup letter)
Monica: Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Monica: I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Monica: So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Monica: Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Monica: Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. Highstakes... big bucks...
Monica: (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Monica: Hell no, we'll pay!
Monica: And you know what? We want a rematch.
Monica: Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Monica: What?
Monica: Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Monica: That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plateslipped out of my hand.
Monica: You're kidding! Where? Where?
Monica: Oh, Rachel!
Monica: Well, what's the job?
Monica: OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since shewas five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!
Monica: I don't think so.
Monica: What?
Monica: Really?
Monica: Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Monica: OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Monica: Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give pokeranother try. Shall we, ladies?
Monica: You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we willwin, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every lastdime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Monica: OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Monica: Excuse me, where are you going?
Monica: Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Monica: Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)
Monica: Me too.
Monica: (slams down cards) I hate this game! 
Monica: Sorry, Rach.
Monica: Alright, check.
Monica: Rachel, there's nothing in it.
Monica: OK, here you go. Good luck.
Monica: (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Monica: That, you get? That, you get?
Monica: Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Monica: Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Monica: What is it?
Monica: Barry who you almost...?
Monica: And Mindy, your maid of...?
Monica: (Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky.To have had a friend like you.
Monica: Hi.
Monica: Wonderful!
Monica: There was nudity!
Monica: Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Monica: Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Monica: Which ones?
Monica: He- he pooped in my shoe.
Monica: Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Monica: Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and secondfloor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Monica: Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol inmy shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Monica: Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Monica: No!
Monica: A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Monica: Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
Monica: Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly toyourself first?
Monica: Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have aseat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Monica: The Luisa from home room!
Monica: No, none at all.
Monica: Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Monica: Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on thatmonkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Monica: Marcel?
Monica: Whaaat!
Monica: What is it?
Monica: Look, Phoebe!
Monica: What're you gonna do?
Monica: Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs afterhim. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?
Monica: Oh gosh.
Monica: This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Monica: That's because I'm in front of them.
Monica: Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Monica: Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Monica: (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come seethis! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Monica: So have you called her yet?
Monica: I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of youpeople.
Monica: Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Monica: How'd it go?
Monica: Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you leftat the altar?
Monica: Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who justhappens to be your ex-best friend?
Monica: That's what you've been working on for the past twohours?!
Monica: (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy withthe telescope!
Monica: Great, now he's waving back.
Monica: What kinda stuff?
Monica: Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also beused as a phone.
Monica: Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Monica: (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss inyour hair?
Monica: Uh huh.
Monica: You had sex in his chair?!... I saidthat a little too loudly, didn't I?
Monica: Brrrrrrr!
Monica: Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Monica: Why don't you just take it with you?
Monica: Why don't you just call her?
Monica: Do you?
Monica: Don't you have to pee?
Monica: Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Justpointing out the irony.
Monica: So she's a woman! So what?
Monica: Joey!!
Monica: The green dress? Really?
Monica: (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!
Monica: You okay?
Monica: Really?
Monica: Aww... (They hug)
Monica: Yeah, there you go!
Monica: I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Monica: I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Monica: That's me.
Monica: Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Monica: This woman's living my life.
Monica: She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this,look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores thatI'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Monica: Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all thisstuff. Only I don't.
Monica: Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Monica: Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the NewSchool?
Monica: This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have mymother.
Monica: Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'mtaking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Monica: (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tapclass.
Monica: This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Monica: What d'you think?
Monica: Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Monica: Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Monica: Okay, I'm not getting this!
Monica: Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievablyuncoordinated?
Monica: Great. It's gym class all over again.
Monica: Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Monica: Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Monica: Yeah. It's Dutch.
Fake Monica: You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks hersomething in Dutch)
Monica: Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
Monica: Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, youforget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazingspirit.
Fake Monica: Monana was very brave.
Monica: It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen.Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Fake Monica: So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short andhave breasts...
Monica: ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Fake Monica: Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Monica: 'Scuse me?
Fake Monica: There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, singMemories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Monica: Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not likeyou. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Fake Monica: Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Monica: What?
Fake Monica: Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Monica: Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Fake Monica: I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie thatchanged my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Monica: Uh-huh.
Fake Monica: I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring.I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play?What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. Iwalked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm nevergetting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Monica: Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Monica: Yo- hooo!
Monica: Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Monica: Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Monica: Water rules!
Monica: Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Monica: No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff thepillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so muchmore than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Monica: Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Monica: They've arrested Monica.
Monica: Hi.
Fake Monica: Hey.
Monica: How are you?
Fake Monica: I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did youknow I was here?
Monica: Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Fake Monica: That I was not expecting.
Monica: I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Fake Monica: Oh. Thanks.
Monica: No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you,I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the WintergardenTheater!
Fake Monica: Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Monica: I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do withoutyou? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the BigApple Circus?
Fake Monica: Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five otherwomen, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Monica: Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Fake Monica: There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back tobeing exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Monica: Not necessarily...
Fake Monica: Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amishthing.
Monica: Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Fake Monica: Really? Then why are you like that?
Monica: In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)
Monica: Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
Monica: Tell him.
Monica: Just...please tell him.
Monica: Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Monica: Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're stillextinct.'
Monica: All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)
Monica: Thank you.
Monica: He's... our age.
Monica: Okay, he's a senior in college.
Monica: No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
Monica: Oh, I can't pass for 22?
Monica: I am 26.
Monica: Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta changethe belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, causeI made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?
Monica: What?
Monica: I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... youknow. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Did not.
Monica: How was that possible?
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Unless...
Monica: Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
Monica: Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretlymarried to a goat?'
Monica: Ethan?
Monica: Are you a virgin?
Monica: Really?
Monica: You keep saying that.
Monica: Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. AndI, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Monica: No-no. Nothing wrong about that. 
Monica: Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months. 
Monica: But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, whatthe hell does it matter how old we are.
Monica: You're not a senior?
Monica: Ok...ay.
Monica: What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn'talive during the Bicentennial.
Monica: Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Monica: Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48states. What were you thinking?
Monica: Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)
Monica: Really?
Monica: Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a schoolnight. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'mJoan Collins.
Monica: What?
Monica: Oh.
Monica: No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Monica: Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Monica: Aren't you gonna...
Monica: That was gonna be my opener.
Monica: It was.
Monica: Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Monica: This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If youwere a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times,I would really...
Monica: ...love you.
Monica: I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Monica: I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Monica: Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Monica: What's with the guitar?
Monica: I want a baby.
Monica: Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Monica: No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Monica: Oh yeah? When?
Monica: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Monica: Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Monica: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Monica: Well?
Monica: Did you go home and change?
Monica: No, I haven't seen him.
Monica: Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross isgreat. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, youdon't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance?(Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet. 
Monica: I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Monica: Hi.
Monica: Can we come in?
Monica: Ross, can I?
Monica: (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'myour Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Monica: He is so amazing.
Monica: Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Monica: Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Monica: OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Monica: Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Monica: Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Monica: Man's got a point.
Monica: Joey... we always know what you mean.
Monica: Hey.
Monica: You're going to China?
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Monica: You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Monica: (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Monica: Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Monica: So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Monica: Y'know, just be there for her.
Monica: Think about it.
Monica: I can't believe he did this.
Monica: I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Monica: No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave foranother forty-five more minutes.
Monica: From here to the airport?
Monica: Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Monica: Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Monica: Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean,it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throwit out?
Monica: Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what thebest part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it'slike starting on the fifteenth date!
Monica: Another good point.
Monica: Why isn't it working out?
Monica: Is he not cute enough for you?
Monica: Does he not make enough money?
Monica: Is there? Is there someone else?
Monica: Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Monica: Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Monica: Oh, from who?
Monica: Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couplehours? At gate 27-B?
Monica: Oh, why?
Monica: (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Monica: I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll begood. I promise.
Monica: Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kindof crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Monica: I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it withRoss! 
Monica: Guys, you got your hair cut.
Monica: This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Monica: (to Julie) It's an expression.
Monica: Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
Monica: No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Monica: Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, Ithought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
Monica: Why not?
Monica: No you're not.
Monica: Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
Monica: (to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back.
Monica: Rachel, how did this happen?
Monica: Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Monica: My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyonelooks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake.
Monica: (to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hairwas so much shorter and cuter.
Monica: I promise.
Monica: What? I didn't say anything.
Monica: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what wehad discussed.
Monica: How who wears it?
Monica: Demi Moore is not a he.
Monica: That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: She's the actress that was in Disclosure, IndecentProposal, Ghost!
Monica: I know!
Monica: Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Monica: Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Monica: (entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these wereunbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but Icouldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)
Monica: Ok, um, I'll go with you. 
Monica: It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Monica: But I'm...
Monica: Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
Monica: You're welcome.
Monica: Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
Monica: We were shopping, and we had lunch.
Monica: You had a salad.
Monica: Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju(Sees Rachel is watching)Hi, Jew! (Walksinto the kitchen.) (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens) Ok. (Listens) Um, sure,that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. (Hangs up.)
Monica: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likesit. Reaffirms his faith.
Monica: Hey, where is everybody?
Monica: Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanksfor your jacket.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Monica: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Monica: Judy.
Monica: Julie.
Monica: Jody!
Monica: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because shewas my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, wewere...shopping.
Monica: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Monica: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry,all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Monica: That is not true!
Monica: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Monica: (on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not assimple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve.
Monica: I don't know what else to say.
Monica: I feel terrible, I really do.
Monica: Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spendsome time together. Is that so terrible?
Monica: It's that terrible?
Monica: Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean,just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,(starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Monica: Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need tohate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met aguy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Monica: (crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)
Monica: God, look what I found in the drain.
Monica: It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do withthis?
Monica: It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean thisis like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)
Monica: God, what is wrong with me.
Monica: I need to get some Richard.
Monica: I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired ofwondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Monica: What are you the memory woman?
Monica: Hi.
Monica: Oh, they-they sent me home.
Monica: Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Monica: I know I do.
Monica: Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Monica: I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Monica: All right, I'll try not to.
Monica: Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Monica: I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Monica: Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
Monica: (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it wasthose videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Monica: Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica,and Phoebe leave)
Monica: Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Monica: I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are youreally doing here Dad?
Monica: What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Monica: Oh.
Monica: I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Monica: No, I really, really do.
Monica: Really!
Monica: You're not just saying that are you?
Monica: Was he crying?
Monica: Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
Monica: I think so.
Monica: (entering) Hi.
Monica: Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
Monica: (to Ross) Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Monica: Hang on a second I just got in.
Monica: Has somebody been drinking my fat? (Joey and Chandler look at each other)
Monica: Rach, did you check the machine?
Monica: Is-is-is that message old or new? (yelling) Old or new?! Old or new?!
Monica: What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we hadsomething really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Monica: Huh?
Monica: If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Monica: So, should I call him back?
Monica: I called him.
Monica: Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay,it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God,what if it wasn't breezy? 
Monica: Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell meif it's breezy enough.
Monica: I know the code to his answering machine.
Monica: (on machine) "Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got thismessage from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. Solet me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Monica: He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Monica: Well, who's voice was that?
Monica: Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Monica: It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Monica: (entering from her room) Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if thatwas her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Monica: Okay. That was her right?
Monica: See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.

I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it ifyou didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Comeon we're friends!! (Michelle hangs up) That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Monica: Okay, fine. (runs to her room)
Monica: Not any more!
Monica: Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazytonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, Ibeeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you knowwhat Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we canforget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
Monica: Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
Monica: (on machine) "Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did somethingkind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know."Nooo!!
Monica: I don't know!
Monica: Noooo!!!!
Monica: Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message.Maybe they can change his number. 
Monica: Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock thismorning.
Monica: Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Monica: I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressedabout Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man?Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joeyrealizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)
Monica: (entering) Hey guys.
Monica: Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin.
Monica: Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Monica: I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even.So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Monica: I'm talking about me having a baby.
Monica: Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of mylife. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that'swhen I came up with the baby plan. 
Monica: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, ifI have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's juststupid.
Monica: I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. Andthere, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Monica: (entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come ondown! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Monica: You're gonna what?
Monica: What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way tosomething....
Monica: Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm soready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Monica: Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor,born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turnand look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Monica: Joey, this is you!
Monica: Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocketscientist here.
Monica: I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Monica: Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Monica: Hey.
Monica: To the bank.
Monica: Sperm.
Monica: Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135. 
Monica: 'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...

Monica: We do not have one of those signs.
Monica: Two girls and a boy?
Monica: And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're,they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three ofthem.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on thecouch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Monica: See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Monica: Oh, now you want a pad.
Monica: (entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my leftboob?
Monica: There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
Monica: What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feelsomething, you have to run away?

Monica: My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Monica: You know what, everything's gonna be okay. 
Monica: If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Monica: Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just wokeup, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Monica: Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)
Monica: What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. Youused to dress up like a woman.
Monica: Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Monica: The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.

Monica: Wasn't there a little song?
Monica: (singing) 'I am Bea.'
Monica: 'I drink tea.'
Monica: '....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '

Monica: First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
Monica: Hey! Where ya headin in those pants? 1982?
Monica: Why, whats wrong with my bathroom floor?
Monica: I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)
Monica: I cant live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Monica: Thats a little more than I wanted to see.
Monica: I cant leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Monica: You know thats nice, y'know we could put it back there after thesurgeons remove it from your colon!
Monica: What kind of karate is that?
Monica: So hows it going with you guys?
Monica: Oh honey, were close now but you-you wouldnt believe theyears of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebeshakes her head like she doesnt understand) Thats where the waistband actuallygoes over your head. 
Monica: Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Monica: Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Monica: I just asked you.
Monica: No, that is what the game is.
Monica: Whats the matter?
Monica: Hes retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)
Monica: Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.

Monica: Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Monica: This place is really my Grandmothers. (Joey starts to take off allof his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.)

Monica: So?!

Monica: (to Ben) Whos so brave, youre so brave, yes you are,youre so brave.
Monica: Hes not gonna say anything, because were not gonna tell him.
Monica: No were not.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Monica: Okay, were gonna need a distraction.

Monica: The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back toyour bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!
Monica: A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Monica: Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Monica: Because hell know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with abear thats dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God, youre a genius!
Monica: Give it. Give it.
Monica: It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Monica: Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.

Monica: Did he just say Monica bang?

Monica: Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)
Monica: No! Listen, Im not gonna go through this with you again, okay.Just once I wanna beat when you cant blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or thefact that you thought you were getting mono. Lets just call this, tie score andits halftime.
Monica: Y'know what? Ill think youll play.

Monica: All right, Ill take one box of the mint treasures, just one, andthats it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross)Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Monica: No.
Monica: Dont, dont, dont, dont, dont do this.
Monica: (she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)
Monica: (comes up and starts looking through Rosss cookie supply) Ross,but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the minttreasures?
Monica: What?
Monica: No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-its no bigdeal, all right, Im-Im cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Monica: (covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)
Monica: Christmas cookie?
Monica: (entering) Hey, guys. Im here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Monica: Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Monica: Oh honey, is that cause your Mom died around Christmas?
Monica: Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a way-to-go thumbsup and smile.)
Joey and Monica: (jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!
Monica: Um-mm.
Monica: Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?
Monica: He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Monica: I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up thereto yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Monica: All right, be my guest.
Monica: Honey, whats the matter?
Monica: Its Joeys birthday.
Monica: Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Monica: I know honey, Im sorry.
Monica: (gives her a look) Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got aYentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Monica: Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean youre going out on a date withthe noisy guy upstairs?
Monica: I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, thenits just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Monica: Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
Monica: (to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.
Monica: Oh my!!
Monica: How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joeys sisters.
Monica: Hi.
Monica: Isnt that great?
Monica: Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left Iactually used the phrase, Hummina-hummina-hummina. (walks away)
Monica: How ya feelin?
Monica: What is the worse part?
Monica: Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actuallygoing to kill you dead.
Monica: I mean, was it Gina?
Monica: No, no, no, thats Dina.
Monica: That was me.
Monica: Thats okay.
Monica: Y'know which one was she again?
Monica: No honey, Im sorry, but the weekends not over yet.
Monica: I guess theyre back from their date.
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: I am good. I finished my book.
Monica: I dont remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Monica: Wait a minute, why dont you just call Mark. (they both look up inshock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, youve got to makestuff happen.
Monica: (to Ross) Honey, its not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Monica: Yay!
Monica: Oh, that is amazing!
Monica: What?
Monica: Are you crazy?!
Monica: What?! Ross y'know this isnt even about you! I mean this is aboutRachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if youreright, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Monica: I mean dont you trust her?
Monica: Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Monica: So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Monica: Yeah, I do know.
Monica: Y'know if its any consolation, he really did sound like he washaving more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)
Monica: Please, I'm not going for anything. 
Monica: Would you please go? 
Monica: Look Julio, someone left their book here. 
Monica: Oh yeah, what are you reading? 
Monica: Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it? 
Monica: Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'Ican't believe I just said that.') 
Monica: Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you writeabout? 
Monica: Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here? 
Monica: How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it. 
Monica: (entering) Hi! 
Monica: It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him evensexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops towrite a poem. 
Monica: Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I amlike totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.(hands them the poem) 
Monica: Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs? 
Monica: Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.(tries to take the poem) 
Monica: All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys. 
Monica: Hey. 
Monica: Oh-ho, look what I got Julio. 
Monica: Yeah, just like the one in the poem. 
Monica: What do you mean? 
Monica: (to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh? 
Monica: Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don'twrite trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazinecomes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does notmean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have noright to make that kind of judgment about me. 
Monica: You don't even know me... 
Monica: What? 
Monica: I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe... 
Monica: (sarcastically) Oh yeah. 
Monica: (to clerk) Hi.
Monica: Six? I just had it for one night. Its three.
Monica: Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, youre gonnahave to help me out here, cause I only have three.
Monica: Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!
Monica: Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.
Monica: Right.
Monica: What?
Monica: (removes them) Thats because I-I was just grabbing some things outof the dryer, and its static cling. Or maybe its just that God knew Idbe running into you and saw an opportunity.
Monica: Its good to see you too.
Monica: You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as weleave hes going straight to the porn.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Me too.
Monica: Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.
Monica: No, I just I think that its too soon.
Monica: (entering from her bedroom) Morning.
Monica: Yeah well, I ran into Richard. 
Monica: Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, wewent out for an innocent burger.
Monica: Tomorrow night.
Monica: Its not a date, okay. Im just gonna teach him how to makelasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Monica: Were not gonna have sex! Okay, nothings changed here. Hestill doesnt want children and I still do, so thats why were just gonnabe friends.
Monica: You say Thank you very much, and then you buy me somethingpretty. Come on, were gonna put are hands in this bowl, and were gonna startsquishing the tomatoes.
Monica: You touch peoples eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Monica: Oops.
Monica: Gotta keep squishing.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt. 
Monica: Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and itshould umm, be..... 
Monica: Umm, youve got some on your pants.
Monica: So, howd the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you oweme three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, Ive been thinking a lot about you too.(listens) I know. Its hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) Its a word!
Monica: Yeah, I do think its better this way. (listens) Yeah, werebeing smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, Im sure.(she opens the doorand its Richard)
Monica: Ill call you back. (starts kissing him)
Monica: So we can be friends who sleep together.
Monica: Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do youcurrently have any other racquetball buddies?
Monica: Oh.
Monica: No! (pushes him) No! 
Monica: Cause if you do that means youd be cancelling it for me, andwere just friends.
Monica: Hi.
Monica: You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to topit off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over herleft breast.) in a grill fire.
Monica: What are you smiling at?
Monica: Yeah, right.
Monica: I love this friend thing!
Monica: Ow!
Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom asRichard starts the tour.)
Monica: (still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?
Monica: (still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And Im justasking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Monica: (gets up) Okay, y'know what, Im not fine, Im not. I mean howcan I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause)Y'know what, what if were friends who dont see other people?
Monica: Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be soterrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stoodup in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Monica: Thats not true, you dont have a moustache.
Monica: Y'know what, Ive got to walk out of here right now, causegetting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I dont think Icould do it again.
Monica: How bout one last game of racquetball?
Monica: Watch the thorns!
Monica: (to Phoebe) Look at you. All jealous.
Monica: Yeah, sure.
Monica: Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Monica: Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Monica: Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Phoebe and Monica: Hey.
Monica: No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Monica: Yeah, Ginger something.
Monica: No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,(singing) the movie star.
Monica: Well, what did you do?
Monica: Y'know what, dont tell us. Well just wait until Chandlergets home, (to Phoebe) because itll be more fun that way.
Monica: You gave her food poisoning!?
Monica: Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Monica: Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Monica: Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
Monica: Well, dont cha wanna?
Monica: Okay, well I do know you.
Monica: Well so?
Monica: (entering) Hi!
Monica: Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milks gone bad.
Monica: So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Monica: Sounds like shes got the ah, whole package.
Monica: Uh-huh.
Monica: Sorry, Pheebs.
Monica: Wed love too.
Monica: Wow! Its like Rachel in High School.
Monica: Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
Monica: I wont give you anything, but youll owe me 2.95.
Monica: Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?
Monica: Okay, lets start with the free messages outside the UN.
Monica: Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So whatcountry is this guy from?
Monica: Wheres that?
Monica: I dont have an atlas.
Monica: Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
Monica: Hold on.
Monica: Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)
Monica: Its a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Monica: Oh, no thanks.
Monica: Well, if you dont have anything to copy, why are you going downthere?
Monica: Wow! Its small.
Monica: So you had fun, huh?
Monica: No.
Phoebe and Monica: Hey.
Monica: Oh no, shes still at work, but she told me to tell you to callher.
Monica: All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.(holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.
Monica: Oh thats my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe)Shes fancy.
Monica: Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like yourfriend Spackel Back Larry?
Monica: Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moice soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?
Monica: Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Monica: Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Monica: Well, I was having a conversation.
Monica: What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have aconversation?
Monica: Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?
Monica: Hey, the mans dog just died.
Monica: It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Yourguy cant even say coupons. (they leave)
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Hows the big anniversary dinner?
Monica: Ohhh, nice.
Monica: What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it andfruit flies everywhere.)
Monica: Thats okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) onmy ceiling! You broke up?!
Monica: Oh no!! 
Monica: Rachel, you and Mark?!
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Oh, theres banana on it.
Monica: So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)
Monica: Oh, good. Thanks.
Monica: Okay, all right dont judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw thisinfo-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before,except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked soamazing....
Monica: Yes! Have you seen it?
Monica: I know!!
Monica: Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rainforest!
Monica: Did that!
Monica: Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Monica: No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now witha little wax.
Monica: Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being sostupid. But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.
Monica: Now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?
Monica: Ow!
Monica: Ow!! Ow!!
Monica: Its okay, its okay.
Monica: We were just waxing our legs.
Monica: Thats right.
Monica: What?
Monica: (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.
Monica: Oh my God.
Monica: Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this andyou didnt tell us?!
Monica: (stopping him) What, what are you doing? You cant go out there.
Monica: Because theyll know weve been listening.
Monica: What if they dont?
Monica: Hey. Its three in the morning. They dont know that Ivecome home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Monica: Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Monica: No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Monica: Its never taken you more than a shower to get over arelationship.
Monica: (seeing her) Okay, lets go!! Lets hit the road!!
Monica: Lets get the show on it! 
Monica: Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and its sooo close.
Monica: Were sorry honey.
Monica: Very bad.
Monica: Chandler!!
Monica: Werent you nine?!
Monica: Were really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Monica: Noo! Ill stay. Hes my brother.
Monica: No! Were gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Monica: Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?
Monica: No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Monica: What?
Monica: Ow!
Monica: (getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Monica: So, if youre parents hadnt got divorced, youd be ableto answer a question like a normal person?
Monica: What?!
Monica: Please!!
Monica: These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, its gotta be Rachel.
Monica: All right then, your bra would still be big.
Monica: Chandler!!
Monica: Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Monica: Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and ahalf? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Monica: So the going for help went well?
Monica: Then why are you smoking?
Monica: (running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only apenny. Lets stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)
Monica: (reading the sign) Whats pleh?
Monica: Huh. Whats doofus spelled backwards?
Monica: I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Monica: Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Monica: Here we go again.
Monica: (shyly) I dont know.
Monica: What I said was, was that I understood. Joeys the one who agreedwith you!
Monica: All right, well call you when we get back.
Monica: (to Joey) Whats so funny?
Monica: Oh. (she laughs)
Monica: Yeah, ah, but Pheebs dont you think hes a little young toget married?
Monica: So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
Monica: And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only goneout with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, yougotta get me back in the game.
Monica: (to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?
Monica: Havent you and I covered that topic?
Monica: Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig,and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Monica: I mean really, think about it.
Monica: Nah, he doesnt do anything for me.
Monica: Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.(realises) All right, I get your point.
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Uh, yeah.
Monica: Here you go.
Monica: As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000tip. His number is on the check, he just did so Id call him.
Monica: Thats Bill Clinton.
Monica: Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete?
Monica: Im not gonna go out with him.
Monica: Or incredibly offensive.
Monica: What the hell is this? (holding up the check)
Monica: Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Monica: Youre supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. Imean, whats-whats the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the wayyou get girls to go out with you?
Monica: What?!
Monica: Okay, umm, youre a loon.
Monica: I dont know.
Monica: Cause I dont want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Monica: Guys, please, Im just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Monica: I know!!
Monica: (opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!
Monica: And thats why, Im not inviting you in for a drink. (startsto leave) Bye.
Monica: (in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?
Monica: Oh, thats sounds great.
Monica: Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, isthat enough lire?
Monica: Why, how much is that?
Monica: Oh, this is so great.
Monica: All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quicklykisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.
Monica: Hello, people who do not live here.
Monica: I gave you a key for emergencies!
Monica: Hes great! I mean we have such a good time together! Hes sofunny, and sooo sweet, and Im not attracted to him at all!!
Monica: Noo!! Its driving me crazy. I mean every other way hes likethe perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Monica: Two.
Monica: Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his headand says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, Im runningout of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am Ionly attracted to guys where theres no future? Either theyre too old, ortheyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me,and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on! I mean,seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?!
Monica: Sure.
Monica: (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, Im gonnasay, midget rodeo.
Monica: Okay. Umm, y'know, I dont think, I dont think I told youthis, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Monica: So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isnt the thing. Umm,the thing is that, right now Im just in a place in my life where I need to focus onme. Y'know what I mean?
Monica: I so wanna be attracted to you.
Monica: Im sorry.
Monica: Its not?
Monica: Well, um, look I-I dont want this to come our wrong, but ah, youseem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasnt attracted too.
Monica: Hey, Rach, how was work?
Monica: By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Monica: Something wrong?
Monica: Wow, youre really crazy about her, huh?
Monica: Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Monica: Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (toRoss) And Im sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Monica: I get the dollhouse!
Monica: Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Monica: Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was toplay with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Monica: Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpapers a little faded, thats okay.Carpets a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Monica: I know!!!
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Whats this?
Monica: Not one that can pee on the roof.
Monica: I dont want a ghost.
Monica: Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-thats it, thats it, allright? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? Theyre not the right size,theyre not Victorian, and they just dont go.
Monica: Its very interesting, Phoebe.
Monica: Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Monica: Youre kidding?! Thats great!
Monica: Oh my.
Monica: Come on Rach, when a guy says hes going to call, it doesntmean hes going to call. Hasnt it ever happened to you?
Monica: Hmm, bite me.
Monica: (from the bathroom) Im in the shower!
Monica: Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the showermassager.
Monica: (runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been afire.
Monica: Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate.
Monica: Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Monica: That was you?!
Monica: Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out. (She starts toskate over to him)
Monica: Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a pieceof paper. So how was youre trip?
Monica: Oh, whatd ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hoteltoiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want somecoffee?
Monica: (popping back up) Regular or decaf?
Monica: Okay. (hands him a cup)
Monica: So what did you do today Pete?
Monica: What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)
Monica: Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Monica: I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Ovenand opened Easy Monicas Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I cantotally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) ButPetes just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Monica: Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-Icant. I couldnt even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Monica: Oh, please. 
Monica: What? Honey.
Monica: Oh God, Im so sorry.
Monica: Oh God!
Monica: Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.(Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! Im kidding!
Monica: What-what was it you were gonna tell us? 
Monica: Okay. Heres the thing.
Monica: I cant do it. Im sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see youhave these feelings for me....
Monica: Huh?
Monica: Oh?
Monica: Oh, thats great! I mean Im-Im sorry, but Im sohappy for you. And now I can work for you!
Monica: Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses himon the cheek) All right, y'know what? Im just gonna roll right into that officeand-and quit!
Monica: Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?
Monica: (rolling towards the office) Im quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rollsthrough a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past thedoor the other way.) Im okay!! Im all right!!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Hey, guess what Im doing tonight.
Monica: Im checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Monica: I know.
Monica: What?
Monica: Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me somethingthat you could tell me.
Monica: Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Monica: Does it have to do with Joey?
Monica: Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by hisbed?
Monica: Does it involve travel?
Monica: Does it involve clogs?
Monica: Clogs.
Monica: Claws?!
Monica: Okay, so it doesnt involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.But, what about Pete?
Monica: What is it?! What about Pete?
Monica: Okay, I feel like Im talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe wouldyou just tell me!
Monica: Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)
Monica: Okay, does it involve something to do with Petes computer company?
Monica: I dont believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! Itsgigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! Id be cold, but Im always cold.Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Monica: Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs him)
Monica: Did you just smell my hair?
Monica: Oh God.
Monica: You still have feelings for me dont you?
Monica: Pete.
Monica: No, its not bad. Its not bad at all. Its-itsreally nice.
Monica: You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the onewho hurts you. Thats why I cant take this job.
Monica: And well, we probably shouldnt see each other anymore. Imsorry.
Monica: Okay, bye. 
Monica: All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (Shekisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and kiss, very passionately.)
Monica: I need two. Im bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriendnow!
Monica: Really? Whos number two?
Monica: Bye-bye!
Monica: Joey, what are you doing?! Its never gonna happen, shesseeing somebody.
Monica: (to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater)
Monica: Uh-huh.
Monica: Phoebe?
Monica: All right. Honey, thats-thats a sleeve. Okay? 
Monica: And! We also have speaker phone. (She turns on the speaker phone.)
Monica: Okay, wait, you gotta hang up cause were gonna be late.
Monica: Of course not.
Monica: Theres our star!
Monica: Hi!
Monica: Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the shortversion.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Yeah. Where were you?
Monica: You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Monica: (entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, youve been up for 24 hours! Goto sleep, honey. Th-this isnt healthy.
Monica: Hey! Didnt you have that outfit on last night?
Monica: Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Monica: Joey, you had the night! 
Monica: When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-andthey talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Monica: Did you like learn about her family?
Monica: Yes!!
Monica: Oh! (They hug, triumphantly.)
Monica: One.

Monica: What?
Monica: (sarcastic) Oh.
Monica: Pete's breaking up with me.
Monica: I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back fromAtlanta, we need to talk.
Monica: Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's somethingbad.
Monica: Really?!
Monica: (starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'knowwhat, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Monica: Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Monica: Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lightsturn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights!Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Monica: No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to behere, so please, do not touch anything.
Monica: I know.
Monica: Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, getout!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automaticallyanswers it)
Monica: I guess that's how.
Monica: Oh its umm, good! It's umm, its good, just here watering theplants.
Monica: Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just soI know, is it good news or bad news.
Monica: Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Monica: Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
Monica: I love you.
Monica: Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
Monica: Oh my.
Monica: And that's Pete's Mom. 
Monica: Would you stop? Weve only been going out a couple of weeks, I meanwe dont even know if hes gonna propose.
Monica: Well if-if thats what it is, then its-its crazy.
Monica: Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, theytell their friends about it.
Monica: Brides magazines?
Monica: It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying inbed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazineshut in amazement.) I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, andits totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean Icant. Right? I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want thesame things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Monica: I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)
Monica: So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Monica: Ooh, nice.
Monica: Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Monica: Yeah?
Monica: Wow.
Monica: Whats that?
Monica: Okay. (not sure of herself)
Monica: You wanna what?!

Monica: So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...

Monica: He didnt ask me to marry him.
Monica: He wanted to tell me hes gonna compete is some ultimate fightingcompetition thingy.
Monica: I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.
Monica: Yeah, but without the costumes.
Monica: So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?
Monica: Whats fish hooking?
Monica: I gotta tell ya, I think its okay to be that guy.

Monica: Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing hisopponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Monica: Four, please. (Ross looks at her) Im really nervous. (Ross givesher the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)
Monica: Please tell me youre stopping now.
Monica: You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Monica: Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible atthis! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!! 
Monica: Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurtyourself like this. So if you have to do this, then youre gonna have to do itwithout me.
Monica: Then Ive gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)
Monica: Yes?
Monica: Really?!
Monica: Joey, she was listing the countries shes done it in.
Monica: (watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. AmI ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Monica: (sarcastic) Thanks!
Monica: Yeah right.
Monica: You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Monica: Well, no. Youre Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)
Monica: Well Id probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Monica: Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Monica: Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Monica: Whats with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of thefloor, which is covered in sand)
Monica: What?!

Monica: Hes totally flirting with you too.
Monica: Huh?
Monica: You didnt even take off your pants.

Monica: What, that little thing at the prom?
Monica: Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Monica: Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Monica: You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride offChips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a banduniform they had to have specially made.
Monica: It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Monica: Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go outwith a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out. And thefat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Monica: Oh, really?!
Monica: Ill try.
Monica: Why cant you use the phone in here?
Monica: Ross, dont start.

Monica: (entering) Oh my God! What happened?
Monica: Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in highschool?
Monica: Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Monica: No, its okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, Igot to dump Chip Matthews.
Monica: I know!
Monica: Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Monica: Me too. (they all leave)
Monica: Because I need the money, and I thought that itd be agreat way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Monica: Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Monica: Let me ask you a question.
Monica: Why did you hire me?
Monica: (to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me becauseshe thinks Im good.
Monica: Oh yeah, she didnt hire me out of pity, it wasntso she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks Im good.
Monica: I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nodYes.)
Monica: What?
Monica: Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Momwouldnt give me grief about me biting them.
Monica: (Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had themput (realises) Oh my God! Its in the quiche! Oh My God!
Monica: Okay ah, please dont freak out. Umm, but ah,theres a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and theres no way to knowwhich one.
Monica: Then why are you laughing?
Monica: What? You bet Id lose a nail?
Monica: Frozen lasagnas?
Monica: You bet that Id screw up?! So all that stuff abouthiring me because I was good was
Monica: (laughs) Thats right. My Mom doesnt have any faithin me! Oh, thats hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Monica: (interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and anawkward silence follows.)
Monica: Hi.
Monica: Ohh, Im such an idiot. I cant believe I actuallythought she could change.
Monica: Oh good, Im glad thats catching on.
Monica: What?
Monica: (getting up) All right, Ill go down there. But, Imnot gonna serve the lasagna. Im gonna serve something I make.
Monica: Well?
Monica: Really?!
Monica: Yes!!
Monica: And you?
Monica: So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would makethis a success. Which would make you
Monica: Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Monica: Wow!
Monica: That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, dont bite yournails.
Monica: (in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile onher face.)
Monica: Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Monica: Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?(Joey is pissed)
Monica: Rachel!
Monica: You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Monica: Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)
Monica: Third door on the left.
Monica: God! If youre gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes tothrough it out.]
Monica: Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we justforget about it.
Monica: (Picking up a card from Chandlers wallet.) My God! Is this a gymcard?
Monica: Whats the matter?
Monica: So do them for free.
Monica: Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Monica: Youre gonna do some feet flirtin!
Monica: What a minute, what did he say?
Monica: I told you not to go down there!
Monica: Rachel always cries!
Monica: Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck likeyouve never sucked before!
Monica: His dancing partner?!
Monica: Oh, would you let it go already?! Youre fine!
Monica: Wait, now so you joined the gym?
Monica: Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Monica: Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distractyourself.
Monica: Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Monica: Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Monica: (laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!
Monica: All right, then show me some manly moves.
Monica: So you didnt leave the bank?
Monica: Oh my Gosh!
Monica: Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's theworst thing that could happen?
Monica: Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get inbed, and stay there.
Monica: Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Monica: That cold makes you sound so great.
Monica: Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Monica: (turning around and doing that, "I'm making out with someone,"thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around andsees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)

Monica: Hey!
Monica: Rachel's not here.
Monica: How's it going with her?
Monica: Hi, Josh.
Monica: So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football forthe rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Monica: Very!
Monica: It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool ourparents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember Icried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I wasactually cooler than my older brother.
Monica: Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Monica: Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
Monica: (sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Monica: (lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.
Monica: What?
Monica: Why?
Monica: Thank you so much Phoebe.
Monica: What are you doing with those?!
Monica: Sorry, Phoebe.
Monica: Umm. (nodding her head, "Good.")
Monica: Ohhhh!! Gross!!
Monica: No, sorry.
Monica: Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Monica: Ross, cough drops, please?

Monica: And what are you laughing at, Miss`My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Monica: That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? Andget me my cough drops!
Monica: Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the asson her? 
Monica: (Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I amsorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral forsixty people. 
Monica: Sixty guests. 
Monica: Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something thatbig on such short notice. I mean there's no way. 
Monica: I don't know. 
Monica: Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies andstuff.

Monica: Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me. 
Monica: Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let'sjust go! 
Monica: I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event. 
Monica: Oh, that's great! Congratulations! 
Monica: Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til shedid.

Monica: Who cares? He works in a museum!
Monica: What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer anda piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!
Monica: Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!

Monica: Oh.
Monica: All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Monica: Hey! My first review is out!
Monica: All right, look at my on the back page.
Monica: Hey, they dont pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Monica: Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Monica: Havent we made this decision?
Monica: Bye!
Monica: (answering it) Who is it?
Monica: Oh my God.
Monica: Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!
Monica: Look, I-Im never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Monica: No! Phoebe!
Monica: I couldnt eat it! I had five friends who couldnt eat it, andone of them eats books.
Monica: The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Monica: All right, that Ill retract. But I stand by my review, I know foodand that wasnt it. Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You shouldserve it with vodka and a piece of celery. 
Monica: Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastesgood?! Where are you even from?
Monica: Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should tastelike! Come on, hand me them.
Monica: Okay, the owner of Allesandros came over to yell at me, butinstead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Monica: Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Monica: You got the job?! Why didnt you tell me?
Monica: Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachelexcuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back fromcatering.
Monica: I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels likeits snowballing, yknow?
Monica: I got offered the head chef job at Allesandros.
Monica: Its okay, cause y'know what? You dont really need mefor the business.
Monica: All right. But umm, I-I-Ill pay you back all the money youinvested, and you can keep the van.
Monica: Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)
Monica: (entering) Ohh, here you are. Yknow, Im-Im glad youdecided to hear me out.
Monica: Ive been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came upwith a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flowerdelivery person.
Monica: Or! A bakery delivery person.
Monica: Pizza?!
Monica: All right, Ive got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, butumm, Im getting the feeling that you dont want to deliver.
Monica: Okay. Im guessing that if you dont want to deliver, youprobably dont want to pick stuff up either.
Monica: Yknow what, lets do the catering business.
Monica: Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Yknow what, itdbe, itd be fun.
Monica: Really?!
Monica: Thank you.
Monica:  Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with apinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have therecipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?
Monica: Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Monica: I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, Iget off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chefshat. (The hat says Quit, bitch)
Monica: I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and theyhad to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs andMonica glares at him.)
Monica: I mean theyre trying to do everything they can to make me quit,and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something Ive been waiting formy whole life.
Monica: I would love too, but I cant! I mean I just cant, you knowthat Im not good at confrontation.
Monica: Thats a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Monica: All right, youre hired!
Monica: Didnt your dad used to call you Pumpkin?

Monica: Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy isnobody writing these down?
Monica: Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them likeyou did the other night?
Monica: Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right heres thething, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positiveatmosphere

Monica: Thats not funny.
Monica: (starting to cry) Im a good person. And Im a good chef, andI dont deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Yknow what, if you want meto quit this bad, then all you have to do is
Monica: You do?

Monica: No, you messed it up. Youre stupid.
Monica: Are you serious?
Monica: What did you tell them?
Monica: Yeah, like youre gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
Monica: We just want you to think it through.
Monica: I am so jealous.
Monica: In the beginning where yknow its all sex and talking and sexand talking and
Monica: And the sex?
Monica: Then what is it?
Monica: So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesntmean hes great in bed.
Monica: Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna begreat, cause you-you guys are in love.
Monica: Yeah, you should.
Monica: Go on.
Monica: I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: What?!
Monica: (to Chandler) So, did you do it?
Monica: Uh-oh, it was bad?
Monica: Well, it was the first time. Yknow, theres not always a lotof agreement the first time.
Monica: All right, Im gonna show you something a lot of guys dontknow. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) Allright. Now
Monica: Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labellingthem) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out theres more thanthree), five, six, and seven!
Monica: Its kind of an important one!
Monica: (continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and setup camp.
Monica: All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hitem all, and you mix em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Monica: All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,6-7, 7, 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7(mouths 7)! (They both leanback on the couch satisfied.)
Monica: Yknow, I never saw that.
Monica: What are you doing?
Monica: Its gonna be so great.
Monica: Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Monica: What if I asked?
Monica: Really?
Monica: No.
Monica: Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Monica: What kind of changes?
Monica: Oh, good luck.
Monica: That is sooo not true!
Monica: I justI cant believe that you think that you and Chandlerknow me and Rachel better than we know you.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Deal!
Monica: Ha-ha!
Monica: Aww, man!
Monica: That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Monica: Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Monica: Are you scared?
Monica: Ross will do it.
Monica: You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Monica: Same category?
Monica: Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
Monica: No!!
Monica: I knew that! Rachel! Use youre head!
Monica: Viva Las Gaygas!
Monica: You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Monica: Huh, wanna bet?
Monica: How about we play for more money, say 150?
Monica: Youre doing it again.
Monica: We wont. (to Chandler) 300?
Monica: Im just trying to spice it up!
Monica: I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Monica: Deal!
Monica: Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game!Look at my hand. (Holds up her hand.)
Monica: No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
Monica: Come on!
Monica: Come on!
Monica: Sandwiches! 
Monica: Maurice.
Monica: And processing.
Monica: Its umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Monica: Thats not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
Monica: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Monica: Man, I feel like Im coming down with something.
Monica: Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you cant guess what color my tonsilsare? Ill bet the apartment!
Monica: How do you feel?
Monica: Really?! How much?!
Monica: Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we wouldvemade them get rid of the birds. Right?
Monica: All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feelbetter, its all your fault.
Monica: Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
Monica: Well?
Monica: Its only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
Monica: Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Monica: Ill take care of it.
Monica: I lost our mattresses.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Hey, dont mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Monica: Hey, we would still be living here if hadnt gotten the questionwrong!
Monica: I cant find garbage bags!
Monica: What is it?!
Monica: I cant believe were living here!
Monica: Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why? 
Monica: Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. Ifyou could just(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)throw your purses atit.
Monica: Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Monica: Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are foodanymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Monica: If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming overall the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now.(She takes back the turkey leg)
Monica: What are you doing?
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Monica: You made pancakes?
Monica: Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive herpancakes.)
Monica: Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Monica: The players.
Monica: (laughs) Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is.
Monica: Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Monica: Please, have some!
Monica: Yeah, Ive just been fiddling around in here making delicioustreats for everyone.
Monica: Yeah, its just something I picked up.
Monica: Wait! Wait! This isnt take-out!
Monica: No, wait, please dont go! Ive got porn for you too!
Monica: People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Monica: Im the hostess! Not those guys! Im always the hostess! Imean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls broughttheir dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Monica: Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. ButIm-Im done now. Theyve suffered enough.
Monica: All right then, when Im done with this place, its gonna beten times better than that place!
Monica: Are you sure?
Monica: Nah, I got it.
Monica: (entering) Okay, its ready. Come on.
Monica: Just come. 
Monica: Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
Monica: You used to have carpet.
Monica: So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? Im just gonna restmy eyes just a little bit.
Monica: Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. Im always thehostess.
Monica: (not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, whatsthis?
Monica: Hey, Joey, I dont think that you should leave Chandler alone. Imean its only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishingnext week?
Monica: Whats Phase Two?
Monica: You stink!
Monica: Uh-oh, whats the matter?
Monica: I dont know sweetie.
Monica: I cant! I have to work!
Monica: No, Chandlers still in Phase One, and Joeys that thing yousmell.
Monica: I think shes here.
Monica: (looking out the peephole) Ohh, shes looking down the hall. Oh!She looked right at me! Oh wait, you cant see people through that little hole, canyou? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!
Monica: I-I-I think you look great.
Monica: What?
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!
Monica: Yeah. Run ten blocks, thatll help the smell.
Monica: So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Monica: What?
Monica: So you hit her in the face?
Monica: Hey! Youre wearing pants!
Monica: Its 9:30 in the morning!
Monica: Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!
Monica: Oh-oh, my God!
Monica: (to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?
Monica: Hes with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
Monica: He had to go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from theorchard.
Monica: Why do you care so much anyway?
Monica: Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Monica: A couple of days.
Monica: What are you doing?! Chandler! You cant just go back a phase!
Monica: Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Monica: (coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, Ivegot some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
Monica: Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancers hotpants) so good.
Monica: (to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Monica: Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpetguy.
Monica: I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)
Monica: So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Monica: What, he doesnt like Josh?
Monica: Yeah. And yknow, if you wanna cry, thats okay too.
Monica: Come on! Chandler!
Monica: They really were pretty, werent they? (Rachel and Phoebe bothagree)
Monica: Oh, Candy! She was so spunky! 
Monica: Yknow, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler isintrigued.) Itd, itd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was sopetite.
Monica: Oh, Chantal!
Monica: Really?!
Monica: Thats-thats not Phase Three.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Monica: Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Monica: Didnt it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what itdid?
Monica: They wouldnt have put it there if it didnt do something! Howcan you not care?
Monica: Janice?!
Monica: How have you been?
Monica: Done?
Monica: This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off andchecked every outlet. Now, four of them dont work. Which means, one of themhas to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outletsthat-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find outwhich one it is.
Monica: Yeah, well, Im using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybodyready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hearsomething! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises its Joey.)
Monica: He asked you out?!
Monica: Saucy!
Monica: Electrical plans for the building.
Monica: I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city halland got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Monica: Hi!
Monica: Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theydbrighten up the place. They do dont you think?
Monica: No-no-no, no!
Monica: I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked thatpicture.
Monica: Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch isconnected to something!
Monica: I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what itdid.
Monica: No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there,I thought it went downstairs.
Monica: But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Monica: All right. The super couldnt figure out what it did. A $200 anhour electrician couldnt figure out what it did. Ive had seven pretty seriousshocks. I officially give up.
Monica: I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Monica: What is it hon?
Monica: Aww, honey Im sorry.
Monica: I dont know how museums work in England but, here, youre notsupposed to take stuff.
Monica: Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Monica: You changed?
Monica: And lucky means, more cleavage? 
Monica: Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
Monica: Or Spin the Bottle?
Monica: Two in a row! Youve got to use your tongues now! (They kissagain.)
Monica: Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Monica: Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I cant let(pause), actuallyI kinda want to see what happens.
Joey and Monica: Are you all right?
Monica: I think youre done.
Monica: Well at least, Im going to mute it.
Monica: Hi!
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Hi.
Monica: Oh. Why didnt you take her?
Monica: You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Monica: Hey, cheer up! Youre gonna see her again, right?
Monica: (interrupting him) No-no-no, dont-dont do the accent.Youve got to see her again.
Monica: Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Monica: No! Yknow, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land,fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Monica: Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Monica: Do you love her?
Monica: You love her!
Monica: Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airportand tell her. Youre probably just gonna catch her just as shes about to go tothe gate. Youre gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" Andshes gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the mostamazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
Monica: Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start toheat up, and then a stewardess comes in (Ross looks at her.) Ive been watchingtoo much porn.
Monica: Where ya going?
Monica: How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Monica: Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Monica: And well, what did she say?
Monica: Oh, youre totally welcome! Whatd she say?
Monica: It is not over! Youre over!
Monica: You know!
Monica: It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she lovesyou. And the reason why she couldnt, is because her feelings were so strong, itscared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from theplane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?
Monica: Are you sure?
Monica: This isnt how its supposed to go, there cant beanother guy.
Monica: Of course theres another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now youhave to prove your love!
Monica: You have to go to London!
Monica: Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Monica: When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Monica: You sat back and let him have her, you didnt fight at all. Am Iright? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Monica: All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could beyou and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Monica: Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Dont let her gowithout a fight!
Monica: All right.
Monica: Okay, good luck!
Monica: Thats sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Monica: Hello.
Monica: Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
Monica: All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
Monica: Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesnt showup by then, then just come on home.
Monica: What are you doing here? You cant be here!
Monica: Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) Iwas right! (Points to Emily) Im right, right?
Monica: Oh.
Monica: Yknow what? It really creeps me out choosing otherpeoples sex clothes.
Monica: Um-hmm.
Monica: Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pinenuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Monica: Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some leftover at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it,then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have tomake your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Monica: So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Monica: Oh, no!
Monica: Emilys straight.
Monica: This totally makes sense!
Monica: Oh, sure it does! In high school, you werent jealous at all eventhough all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Monica: This is so much fun!
Monica: Look, all were trying to say is, dont let what happened withCarol ruin what you got with Emily.
Monica: Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Monica: Yknow what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay,I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Shut up! This place is a hole!
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Monica: Yeah, apparently, theyre pretty good seats.
Monica: Yeah, what, do you think were stupid?
Monica: What do you say?
Monica: Have you even had a girl up here?
Monica: (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Monica: All right, so what do you say?
Monica: Oh, just do it!!
Monica: Theyre green?
Monica: Thats not even a game!
Monica: You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, highcard wins. What do you say?
Monica: Oh, good.
Monica: Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.
Monica: Because we won our apartment back!
Monica: No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
Monica: But, we pick again! We pick again!
Monica: I dont know!
Monica: Well discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)
Monica: No, were not! Were not leaving!
Monica: As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Monica: Men are such idiots.
Monica: Yeah, let-let-lets pretend thats not true.
Monica: What-whats going on?
Monica: When, when didhow, how did you
Monica: (to Ross) I cant believe youre getting married! 
Monica: Chandler, thats like your fourth cup of coffee!
Monica: Hes in a different room! Hes really that loud?
Monica: Yknow I used to go out with this guy that was a really lightsleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over
Monica: He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Monica: Have you guys picked a date yet?
Monica: Ugh, shes upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell yasomething! Im not doing them this time! I dont care if those dishes sit in thesink until theyre all covered withIll do them when I get home!
Monica: Ill pick it up for you!
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! Its so beautiful!
Monica: Oh, yes, umm, Im here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
Monica: Emily Waltham.
Monica: (laughs) Okay.
Monica: I am, arent I?
Monica: Yes?
Monica: All right. (Goes to take off the dress.)
Monica: Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates?Yes! I believe she does. (Looks at the wedding dress and stops.)
Monica: Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming.(Theres a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!
Monica: Phoebe?
Monica: Can you just hold on for one minute?
Monica: Are you alone?
Monica: All right.
Monica: Okay, ready?
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Congratulations!
Monica: Okay! My turn! My turn!
Monica: (cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual)Yeah.
Monica: (upset) That was a terrible throw!!
Monica: Look at me! My big concern is whats real?! (Finally realises) Ohmy God. Were really sad, arent we?
Monica: This isnt even my dress.
Monica: Im changing out of this.
Monica: In like a half-hour?
Monica: Okay, throw it straight this time.
Monica: Im getting married next!!
Monica: Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didnt you startfeeling silly?
Monica: Oh God.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Monica: No, seriously.
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? Cause I dont think youhave to wear it unless you are!
Monica: Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything thathes gonna call you again.
Monica: Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
Monica: Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emilys wedding dress intoRachels room.)
Monica: Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause)Maybe someday, there will be.
Monica: Oh God! Hes gonna come by and borrow some candles for his bigdate!
Monica: No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!
Monica: Rachel?!
Monica: Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (ToRachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember mybrother Ross? 
Monica: Ohh, this is soo amazing! I cant believe my brothers gettingmarried! And in London! Its so romantic!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: I never knew that either.
Monica: Were hanging out.
Monica: Im sorry honey.
Monica: Rach, youre gonna come though arent you?
Monica: You know what would be real weird? Is if you werent there. Justsay youll think about it, okay?
Monica: I can't believe he did this.
Monica: You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Monica: Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Monica: Oh, dad, turn it off.
Monica: If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Monica: (to Ross) I can't believe you did that.
Monica: (seeing the decision) Nooooo. Youre really not going?
Monica: You dont have a car. And your license expired. 
Monica: Thats also like the tenth time you told us.
Monica: What?
Monica: I thought that was a good thing.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Yeah, theres one right under the cabinet. 
Monica: Why do you need it?
Monica: What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come youre having a partyand were not invited?
Monica: Sooo?
Monica: Nooo!
Monica: The baby shower for Phoebe!
Monica: Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachelwhat she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for thebabies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?
Monica: Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (Its a little pinkand white dress for the girl baby.)
Monica: I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Monica: Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
Monica: Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use aftershes done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Monica: Oh, shes gonna love that!
Monica: Hi Phoebe.
Monica: Hormones.
Monica: Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. Thats great. So how-howare things going?
Monica: Heres your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take astep back.)
Monica: Im so glad you liked it.
Monica: What?!
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: Wait, you cant have the baby here! I mean I haventsterilised it since the guys moved out!
Monica: Rachel, get the book! The book!
Monica: The Bible?!
Monica: How do you feel?
Monica: Some moms do that.
Monica: Aww, sweetie, but its not like youre not gonna haveanything. Youre gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways thats evenbetter.
Monica: I mean, youre the one theyre gonna come to when they wannarun away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time toget a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London,there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)
Monica: Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera,check! Travellers cheques, check! 
Monica: Myself. Yknow for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a goodthing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Yep! You got the tickets?
Monica: Okay, if you need the vacuum, its in my closet on the left-handside. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator
Monica: Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Monica: All right, yknow what? We really are late! Lets go!Lets go! Lets go!!
Monica: Chicken Kiev?
Monica: Yeah, yknow, but something like salmon which would be so much moreelegant than the chicken. And, you wouldnt have to worry about the salmonella. (Rosspushes her.) So, I cant wait to see this place youre getting married!
Monica: Its nice.
Monica: (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found outwhat happened. 
Monica: They torn it down a few days early.
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: (laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Monica: Umm
Monica: She said that?!
Monica: Why?!
Monica: Oh my God. Youre even dumber than I am!
Monica: Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Monica: Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since thefirst time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. Thats what wedid! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfectfour-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross getsthrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the mostimportant part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all thatother stuff was.
Monica: Sometimes we were.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Youll see.
Monica: And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a littlealcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and (Points to Ross) Yougo.
Monica: Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
Monica: Hey.
Ross and Monica: Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Monica: Ha ha, a joke thats funny in all countries.
Monica: (Looking nauseous from her parents kissing.) And Im going to go getdrunk. (Gets up to get a drink.)
Monica: I was laughing. (Patting him on the knee.)
Monica: Well I didnt want everyone to think I was stupid.
Monica: My mothers driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. Imhappy. (A drunken man approaches.) Im not going to let anything spoil that.
Monica: Well, thanks, we like him.
Monica: Then why would he say it?
Monica: Oh, my mothers right. Im never going to get married.
Monica: Ohh, Please?! Im a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Monica: (Comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew Iwas here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.)
Monica: (In am uneasy voice.) Nope. (She chuckles uneasily.)
Monica: Yep, yep...You?
Monica: Well...Id better get going.
Monica: (Scoots towards the side of the bed.) Could you not look?
Monica: Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
Monica: (Angrily.) You can let some of them go by!(Judy and Andrea go to the frontof the chapel. Joey approaches Monica.)
Monica: (Awkwardly.) Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You knowsometimes I dont even like Chandler.
Monica: Stupid.
Monica: What were we thinking?
Monica: Oh yeah. Definitely.
Monica: Hey.
Monica: I know. How could we have let this happen?
Monica: Ugh! Well, yknow, we were away
Monica: I blame London.
Monica: So look umm, while were st-still in London, I mean, we can keepdoing it right?
Monica: Only here.
Monica: Ill meet you there in two minutes.
Monica: (impatiently) Now?
Monica: Oh, I-I dont know.
Monica: Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)
Monica: Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave,but is stopped by Rachel.)
Monica: Wait. Rachel, no, hes married. Married! If you dont realizethat, I cant help you.
Monica: Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Monica: Why?!
Monica: Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldnt eat meatuntil she has the babies!
Monica: Thats true.
Monica: Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Monica: Yes, I want to change. And why-why dont you go down and get us atable?
Monica: (elbows him) Fifteen minutes.
Monica: Great
Monica: But my clothes areohh! (They both leave.)
Monica: No time for that!
Monica: Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. Its My Giant!
Monica: You really think this is okay?
Monica: Oh, its so beautiful. Ohh! Yknow, I-I dont know if Ifeel right about this.
Monica: Okay!
Monica: You didnt find her?
Monica: Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Monica: Or 45.
Monica: Well, its getting late.
Monica: Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for NewYork.
Monica: I know, Ive been looking at those doors, they look pretty soundproof, dont you think?
Monica: Yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again.
Monica: Im gonna go to the bathroom, maybe Ill see you there in abit?
Monica: I know!
Monica: Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Monica: Well, we certainly are alone.
Monica: Right. Umm, listen since were-we-re on that subject, umm, I justwanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, whatwith my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Rosss mother
Monica: Well, an-anyway, I justthat night meant a lot to me, I guessIm just trying to say thanks.
Monica: (laughs) Thats okay.
Monica: And youre cute too.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: That counts!
Monica: You look cute in bubbles.
Monica: Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Monica: Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Monica: Bodington's!
Monica: Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch)she should be here by now.
Monica: No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Monica: Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Monica: I'll do it!
Monica: Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and youat the reception.
Monica: Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Monica: Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)
Monica: Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Monica: Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, Iknow that wasn't about me.
Monica: If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would noticethat there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns tolisten in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Monica: (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points atanother guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with atthe counter that time.
Monica: You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make yourdecisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Monica: We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of usat the Tower of London.
Monica: What happened?
Monica: See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Monica: What took you so long?
Monica: Oh, good. 
Monica: Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Monica: (Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I droppedsome socks.
Monica: What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do youwant to fall into the trap?!
Monica: I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, youlisten to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! Whatthe hell were you trying to do?
Monica: (Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Monica: I make the decisions, and I say no.
Monica: You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say,"I'm not fired!" Ha!
Monica: Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Monica: Rachel locked the door.
Monica: Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Monica: Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Monica: I really need to talk to you.
Monica: Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wantedto do?
Monica: Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is areally stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knowswho she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.
Monica: All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before youtell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea.Because I bet you, you can't.
Monica: Please!
Monica: Joey, I'm in!
Monica: Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in CentralPark!
Monica: Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.) 
Monica: Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Monica: Come on Rach, let's go.
Monica: No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Monica: Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someonethat you love them and not have them say it back?
Monica: Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)
Monica: Oh my God! You're water broke!
Monica: I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Monica: Do you know anything about women?
Monica: That's all right. 
Monica: Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Monica: Oh man! I did it again!
Monica: What?
Monica: That's what it sounded like.
Monica: Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't thinkso.
Monica: Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reasonand-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Monica: Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Monica: Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Monica: Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get outof it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Monica: Feeling a little better sweetie?
Monica: Me too.
Monica: (entering with Chandler) Hey!
Monica: (To Phoebe) How are you doing?
Monica: Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really,really!
Monica: Chandler!
Monica: So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Monica: Oh, great!
Monica: Bye Dan!
Monica: Great!
Monica: Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goofaround with him.
Monica: I think you're better than you think you are.
Monica: (interrupting) Know when to stop.
Monica: Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (Theykiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don'tdo the dance.
Monica: I think you're my favorite.
Monica: I don't care.
Monica: Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Monica: (In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you. 
Monica: (pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I wastaking a nap.
Monica: Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work!Ha!
Monica: Uh-huh, that one!
Monica: (Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm (Rachel opens the door.) It'sjust Joey and Ross.
Monica: But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Monica: Vomit tux? Who vomited ony'know what, what you up to Joe?
Monica: Oh that's great!
Monica: What's wrong with PBS?
Monica: Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyoneyet.
Monica: I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?
Monica: Hey!
Monica: That's great!
Monica: What?!
Monica: But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.
Monica: Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to anothercountry so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Monica: Sure!
Monica: Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secretboyfriend.
Monica: Great!
Monica: What?! You can'twhat did you tell her?
Monica: Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Monica: No, you cannot.
Monica: (answering it) Hello.
Monica: Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
Monica: (Looking at the TV) You're not on TV.
Monica: (entering) Hi Chandler.
Monica: Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Monica: William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Monica: Yeah, so?
Monica: Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Monica: Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happydance.)
Monica: A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decisionwith a toy!
Monica: All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sextonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Monica: Keep talking.
Monica: Really?
Monica: Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps intohis arms.) Oh my When is Joey gonna be home?
Monica: But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Monica: Yeah. (She takes them off.)
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Ow!
Monica: I know!
Monica: Never done that before.
Monica: (quietly) Hi!
Monica: Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9looks like.
Monica: I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Monica: All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Monica: Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have inJersey!
Monica: Wait! What about Joey?
Monica: (entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'mgoing to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Monica: Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conferencecould've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Monica: Hey.
Monica: No, she's out shopping.
Monica: Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?How is that even gonna work?
Monica: Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Monica: Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles
Monica: Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Monica: Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Monica: Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back. 
Monica: We're switching rooms.
Monica: No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn'tchange the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come onsweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Monica: We're switching rooms again.
Monica: This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Monica: (To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just asecond?
Monica: Chandler!
Monica: Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonnalet 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Monica: Okay, this one I like!
Monica: Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entireweekend like this?
Monica: Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Monica: I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albanyto Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Monica: We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it,what is the matter with you?
Monica: What did you say?
Monica: (entering) Hi!
Monica: Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Monica: Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don'tappreciate really good food.
Monica: Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)
Monica: Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay myhalf.
Monica: 300 dollars?!
Monica: Urghh!!
Monica: Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Monica: Maybe I could do it.
Monica: Hey.
Monica: You're not gonna be phased out!
Monica: Hi.
Monica: Yeah, it did.
Monica: What?
Monica: Why, exactly?
Monica: Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight withsomeone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh! (They both realize somethingthere.)
Monica: (laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it andmove on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Monica: Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)
Monica: I'm afraid so.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Monica: Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Monica: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Monica: Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?Just promise you won't tell.
Monica: I know, it's great!
Monica: Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Monica: Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Monica: Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it meanssomething!
Monica: Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave andclose the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)
Monica: What?!
Chandler and Monica: Okay.
Monica: Sorry.
Monica: (To Chandler) Rachel's at work.
Monica: Hey, what's that?
Monica: What is that?
Monica: (looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.
Monica: So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Monica: Now calm down Joey.
Monica: Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he'shappy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are youcool with that?
Monica: Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to waituntil I find the little waffle iron.
Monica: All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath thecan of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food isunderneath the can of poison?
Monica: Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Monica: We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepyman!
Monica: And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Monica: Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people wefog!
Monica: We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Wow! That guy is so rude!
Monica: Well you did a little bit.
Monica: I totally forgive you!
Monica: Yes!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Monica: Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Monica: No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you'rehaving to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Monica: God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Monica: Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Monica: Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Monica: Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Monica: How did that happen?
Monica: I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Monica: Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'llall be hanging out together.
Monica: I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uhyou-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)
Monica: How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
Monica: Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Monica: Oh, Larry.
Monica: Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
Monica: Larry?
Monica: Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I knowthat you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Monica: It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it. 
Monica: Thanks.
Monica: Hmm?
Monica: He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you'renot gonna try
Monica: Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Monica: (To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Monica: Ohh, fun!
Monica: Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Monica: And you're not gonna do that.
Monica: So-so there is no party.
Monica: I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likesyou.
Monica: Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Monica: You are?
Monica: Okay.
Monica: What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Monica: Great. So the ball is in his court?
Monica: Hey!
Monica: I don't know, clean places?
Monica: (looking through the peephole) It's Danny.
Monica: (to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say itstarts later?
Monica: The fake kind! 
Monica: We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)
Monica: Okay, great! 
Monica: Just go over and say hi.
Monica: Hey, Danny!
Monica: (turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food.Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying thisRachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quicklyretreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm,what's this? (Points to his plate.)
Monica: Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-andwhat-what's this? (Points again.)
Monica: (upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.
Monica: I thought there wasn't a ball?
Monica: I think I need a drink.
Monica: Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Monica: That's very nice.
Monica: Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Monica: Oh, let's not tell this story.
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Hey, did you get the turkey bastedOh my God! Oh my God! (She seessomeone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?
Monica: What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Monica: Well, get it off now!
Monica: Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at myparent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Monica: Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legsas wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!
Monica: Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Monica: That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Monica: Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Monica: Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Monica: I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One WithThe Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. Shegoes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!
Fat Monica: Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Fat Monica: Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Fat Monica: Ross! (Wanting to be introduced.)
Fat Monica: Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Fat Monica: Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheesefor dinner.
Fat Monica: dammit! (Runs off.)
Fat Monica: I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with NancyBranson.
Fat Monica: Call them mom and dad you loser!
Fat Monica: Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Fat Monica: Okay!
Fat Monica: Oh that's so great!
Fat Monica: Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'lltell me everything.
Fat Monica: I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely knowwhether or not you did it!
Fat Monica: No. No, thank you!
Monica: Well, I do.
Monica: Yes, it was!
Monica: (interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready forChristmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Monica: Hi, Chandler.
Monica: What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (Sheturns around making sure he gets a good look.)
Monica: So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Monica: Well it didn't!
Monica: Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heartis not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got himback, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and thenI'm going to point at him and laugh!
Monica: How?
Monica: What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weightso that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock thedoor and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Monica: Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Monica: What do you mean?
Monica: (excited) I can do that!
Monica: Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides tofollow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni andcheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Monica: Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds thembetween her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-andhold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm,and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up aknife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder)and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have anyexposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and thebox between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)
Monica: Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that(She drops the box andin a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flipsthrough the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)
Monica: Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of herpurse and hands it to the doctor.)
Monica: What?! What is it?
Monica: God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
Monica: Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Monica: I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Monica: I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Monica: Chandler! (Follows him out.)
Monica: Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Monica: Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Monica: Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
Monica: Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
Monica: I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
Monica: What?
Monica: You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Monica: Yes, you did!
Monica: You love me!
Monica: Yeah!
Monica: (entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Monica: (inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a toughspot.
Monica: We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't wanteveryone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going reallywell is because it's a secret.
Monica: We are! Help us!
Monica: Joey!
Monica: Hey, Phoebe!
Monica: Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I wasgoing to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)
Monica: Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
Monica: Phoebe?
Monica: Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Monica: We're so sorry.
Monica: Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Justgive us a little more time.
Monica: Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, Ithought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)
Monica: I know.
Monica: Ross, are you okay?
Monica: Why?!
Monica: A pill?
Monica: Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
Monica: (yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!
Monica: (grabbing the picture) Give me that!
Monica: It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Monica: Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Monica: Oh no!
Monica: Yes it's true.
Monica: I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir. 
Monica: I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Monica: I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Monica: (entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I justconvinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Monica: Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) Weshould have essay questions!!
Monica: You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was verypopular. (Chandler laughs.)
Monica: Danny? You know Rachel? Shes nice. Shes not bad to lookat, right?
Monica: Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Monica: Fridays perfect...She cant wait.
Monica: (Walking in from off screen.) Phoebe!
Monica: I just wanted to see how it's going.
Monica: (Taking out her wallet.) Well good, here let me help you out. 
Monica: Yeah!
Monica: Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)
Monica: Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of herchange purse into the bucket.)
Monica: Hey, what's up?
Monica: Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Monica: You had no relationship!!
Monica: Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl?Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date withDanny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subwaygirl.
Monica: Come on, hurry!
Monica: No.
Monica: No.
Monica: Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)
Monica: Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Monica: Still, I was quick as a cat.
Monica: Oh, you're kidding.
Monica: (laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Monica: Too strong for me?
Monica: You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wannago?
Monica: Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They startwrestling.)
Monica: That was unbelievable! 
Monica: Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
Monica: It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can reallyappreciate it?
Monica: This is disgusting!
Monica: Oh no, wait! Joey!
Monica: Happy New Year.
Monica: She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose thanyou do of not making fun of us.
Monica: Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Monica: Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Monica: Hi Ben!
Monica: I like 'em.
Monica: I like them a lot.
Monica: It's my New Year's resolution!
Monica: No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really thinkit's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Monica: Thank you. (Leaves.)
Monica: (on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Rosspicks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Monica: (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
Monica: We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Monica: Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben'spicture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Monica: See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Nowthat's something.
Monica: Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna godo my laundry.
Monica: Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are wecelebrating?
Monica: I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be areal couple. We don't have to hide.
Monica: Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)
Monica: Hi, nice to meet you!
Monica: What was that?
Monica: That noise you just made?
Monica: Really? Your work laugh?
Monica: All right, check me out.
Monica: Really?
Monica: Hey, I thought you already had one.
Monica: Hi!
Monica: What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Monica: Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Monica: Okay. Umm
Monica: Okay, what's going on with you?
Monica: Well, I-Ithere was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, butI don't anymore.
Monica: Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Monica: Game!
Monica: Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to becarved!
Monica: I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Monica: Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she'spopping pills.
Monica: They have racquets don't they?!
Monica: I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Monica: I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug andKara and scores a point.)
Monica: I got it!!
Monica: I can't believe you let them win!
Monica: I was frustrated.
Monica: I was frustrated with you!
Monica: Y'know what really bothers me? Isit's how-how different you act aroundthem! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see youaround, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" (Mocks the fake laugh.) Igotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Monica: I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Monica: Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.)Where the hell have you been?!!
Monica: My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Monica: What?!
Monica: Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let meknow how that one turns out.
Monica: Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr.Big(Thinks)ot.
Monica: Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Monica: Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)
Monica: Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Monica: (To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Monica: Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will beit for me on the work things.
Monica: I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging outwith my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Monica: (interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Monica: Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You seeKara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it wasweak physically. You get it now honey?
Monica: I thought you could use the help.
Monica: Sorry! I'm justI'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hatehaving to lie to Rachel!
Monica: I know! It's just thatever since high school Rachel was the one person Itold everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Monica: (entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Monica: Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover thefact that she's wearing men's boxers.]
Monica: Okay great! 
Monica: Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I wascleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Monica: Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: I'll get back to my new job.
Monica: I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! Sogood for Monica! 
Monica: That was a half an hour?
Monica: Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the bestmassages!
Monica: It's so good, isn't it?
Monica: Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Monica: (entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in acar right outside.
Monica: Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Monica: (to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How didshe die?
Monica: What?! What honey?
Monica: Oh, did you catch him?!
Monica: All right, let's go say good-bye.
Monica: Well, at least you scared someone.
Monica: Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you. 
Monica: What are you talking about?
Monica: (indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them toRachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (Shestarts giving Chandler a massage.)
Monica: No he's not!
Monica: What?!
Monica: You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Monica: But the minute we start to lie to each other (Pauses after sherealizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society.
Monica: No.
Monica: Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-Ijust wish you could tell mejust say, "I don't like your massages."
Monica: (starting to cry) See? It's no big deal.
Monica: I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened atwork.
Monica: (bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Monica: Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Monica: I'm crying here!!
Monica: Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best badmassage, well who would get that?
Monica: So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Monica: Okay. I suck!
Monica: Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
Monica: You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Monica: Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Monica: What?
Monica: What are you talking about?
Monica: That's not possible!
Monica: I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you werecharming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Monica: I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Monica: This bicep?
Monica: Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Monica: Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Monica: Okay.
Monica: I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Monica: Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Monica: Well what did you send?
Monica: Bye!
Monica: Actually, I did!
Monica: Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Monica: Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the onlyexplanation for it!
Monica: Them?! Who's them?
Monica: Joey!
Monica: Unless
Monica: Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But seethey don't know that we know that they know! So
Monica: (in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!
Monica: Oh yeah!
Monica: All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sexwith her! It'll totally freak her out!
Monica: Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Monica: Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Monica: Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)
Monica: She's bluffing!
Monica: You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Monica: Of course.
Monica: I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
Monica: Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Monica: What are you doing?!
Monica: Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Rossis trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (ToRoss) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Monica: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it'strue, I love him too.
Monica: Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Monica: But what?
Monica: In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Monica: I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doingafter preschool?
Monica: Isn't this great?
Monica: Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.)Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Monica: Are you okay?
Monica: What-what are you doing?
Monica: Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
Monica: Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking aroundabout marriage and stuff.
Monica: Oh and you know what I want!
Monica: I do not have baby fever!
Monica: Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is aboutyou and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Monica: You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Racheltonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! Anddid you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)
Monica: Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?
Monica: I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Monica: What?!
Monica: Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonnahave to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to bein a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)
Monica: (raising her hand) I'm Monica.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Monica: No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Monica: Chandler, why are you doing this?
Monica: Chandler.
Monica: Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is becauseyou're sorry?
Monica: (kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and Iwant you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Monica: Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I neversaid I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Monica: Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Monica: Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with thisrelationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Monica: Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Monica: Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane youwere so, a long time.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: (checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)
Monica: I know.
Chandler and Monica: Okay.
Dream Monica: Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Dream Monica: Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dogbut
Dream Monica: Yes! You are so smart! (Kisses him.) I love you.
Monica: Wow!
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Monica: I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Monica: Are you saying I smell bad?
Monica: What's with him?
Monica: (cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
Monica: Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)
Monica: What is going on with you?
Monica: What was the dream about?
Monica: Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesnt mean that-that you're in love withme!
Monica: No!
Monica: Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and wey'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Monica: Um-hmm.
Monica: Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowlyrealizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because youjust want a girlfriend!
Monica: You become friends after?
Monica: (laughing) That's right.
Monica: Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Monica: What about the closeness?
Monica: Who is it?
Monica: Let me try. (Gets up to join them.)
Monica: Did I squeeze it too hard?
Monica: Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Monica: Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Monica: (joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Monica: What happened?
Monica: No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV. 
Monica: What?
Monica: Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Monica: I know it is the best.
Monica: What? It's still going on.
Monica: I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Monica: (Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't youjust calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why dont you just get all your facts before yourun around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Monica: Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and Iare also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Monica: You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)
Monica: (entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Laurencalled, you got a second interview!
Monica: Yes!
Monica: A kiss? What are you talking about?
Monica: He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Monica: Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Monica: What are you doing?
Monica: (That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck isthat with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) Oh, we're notseeing a movie!
Monica: Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me andChandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Monica: Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see youfor a second?
Monica: Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have got to beatthem! {Here we go yet again.}
Monica: 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Monica: So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove themwrong!
Monica: Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
Monica: We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're thebest.
Monica: No, you're the best.
Monica: I am the best.
Monica: (looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at youthe other day?
Monica: Why?
Monica: What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviouslylives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Monica: No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know theother one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Monica: You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what Imean. You know what I mean?
Monica: Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Monica: You didn't!
Monica: The park huh? A public place.
Monica: I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for thebathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)
Monica: Hi Chandler.
Monica: Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.Haven't you?
Monica: Come on, we can't let them win!
Monica: Because Phoebe and Gary are inthat-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Monica: I feel really sad that we're notreally there anymore.
Monica: Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each otherall the time?
Monica: Really?
Monica: That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, Ifeel the same way.
Monica: Yeah. (They hug.)
Monica: Did not.
Monica: Okay, I freaked out a little.
Monica: Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Monica: Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Monica: I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and justinvite her close friends.
Monica: I would love to do it together!
Monica: It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Monica: That doesn't seem fair.
Monica: Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say youwanna get some fresh air.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)
Monica: All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus,umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music,here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go reallygood with the food.
Monica: Oh, we're not doing that. Okay
Monica: What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty ofthings for you to do!
Monica: (Thinks) Cups.
Monica: And ice!
Monica: Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant
Monica: Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Monica: Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) "Audition didn't go sowell. (Happily) Yeah it did?"
Monica: You got a callback too didn't you?
Monica: (To Rachel) How did work go?
Monica: You stink!
Monica: No, I'm-I'm serious!
Monica: That's so gross!
Monica: Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'mnot kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)
Monica: (overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!
Monica: Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they'reall filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Monica: Y'knowgo! Go! Right there! (Points)
Monica: That's the surprise!
Monica: (entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Monica: So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night inLondon
Monica: Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Monica: That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Monica: That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Monica: (runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!
Monica: You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay?Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Monica: Great!
Monica: (noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?
Monica: It's a diaper commercial.
Monica: What's goin' on?
Monica: It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Monica: It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Monica: Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't meananything with you!
Monica: Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Monica: What?
Monica: (following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going toleave as soon as the show is over.
Monica: No you didn't.
Monica: Yeah, it's good.
Monica: Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, whichthey do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Monica: Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Monica: No way!
Monica: Well that's pathetic!
Monica: And this goes for all guys?
Monica: No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
Monica: (entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe givesher the one-minute sign.)
Monica: Yeah, what is it?
Monica: (shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost ityou lost it.
Monica: All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Monica: Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?
Monica: (angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachellooks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it'snot my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Monica: Yes!
Monica: What about these? These look the same?
Monica: Not as each other! 
Monica: Hi!
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Monica: Oh, honey, the earrings
Monica: My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Monica: Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emilygets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finallyorganize these photos!
Monica: Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we gotholidays, birthdays, candids, y'know And then what I've done is I'vecross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdaysand dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)
Monica: You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Monica: All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Monica: I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype. 
Monica: All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need somecash.
Monica: Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around
Monica: What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that! 
Monica: (on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Monica: I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt,some margarita mix, and tequila.
Monica: See if he has ice.
Monica: (does Rachel's) Nooo!
Monica: Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Monica: We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her backand then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling,neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Monica: I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Comeon! Doesnt that give me the right to control himhelp him?
Monica: No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking aboutrunning out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing whatshe just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What'she gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! Imean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine,all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the samepeople.
Monica: Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying toplay on him.
Monica: All right, I guess we should go.
Monica: Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)
Monica: There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Monica: Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue withyou! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part ofit.
Monica: Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Monica: Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make afantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of youguys.
Monica: No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna getsome tea.
Monica: So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Monica: (shocked) Oh my God!
Monica: I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Monica: I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I justcan't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, justcouldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers.Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral
Monica: (sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Monica: He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but Icouldn't hold it in any longer!
Monica: Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Monica: Ohhhh!
Monica: That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to hertea.)
Monica: (entering) Hey guys!
Monica: Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter)It was right here, where is it?
Monica: All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
Monica: Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute andjust help me find it!
Monica: What?!
Monica: Really?!
Monica: (on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it intowork today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch itway over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sickagain) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs upand keeps throwing the ball.)
Monica: Rach?
Monica: You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms arecovered with scratches.)

Monica: (jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Monica: He's a dropper!
Monica: Oh myOh good God!
Monica: So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Monica: Rach, why won't they take it back?
Monica: Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out whatto do with it.
Monica: Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! Myvision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay.It's okay. Man, that was close.

Monica: Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-checktime!
Monica: Please! I made this game what it is.

Monica: All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guysall stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later.
Monica: Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
Monica: Wow! You made a profit!
Monica: All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Monica: It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No oneneeds to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only officialballplayers can drop the ball!
Monica: Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the doorand everyone watches her leave.)
Monica: (To Rachel) Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Monica: Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Monica: It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Monica: Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I? (And onthe "I" part she mimics poking her eye.)
Monica: Bye!
Monica: Why are so mad at him?
Monica: Well, it just seems that
Monica: Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go.
Monica: Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Monica: No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! Allright, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closesshe sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)
Monica: (looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Monica: I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Monica: A small puff of air, now come on!
Monica: Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Monica: Okay. (Monica backs off.)
Monica: Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C FD.
Monica: I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.)(To Rachel) And you don't get one!
Monica: They're still in my coat.
Monica: I love you.
Monica: I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Monica: Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Monica: Chandler! What are you doing here?
Monica: Not even close.
Monica: Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Monica: Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.)
Monica: Put your head back.
Monica: All right.
Monica: Now, open your eyes.
Monica: How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.)
Monica: Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Monica: Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run?Okay?
Monica: No drops!
Monica: Okay.
Monica: On three, 123! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid thedrops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed theeyedropper.)
Monica: Then why did you move?!
Monica: All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch byher legs.)
Monica: I am going I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto herstomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm I am going to get these drops in your eyes.(She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.) 
Monica: (spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!
Monica: (answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe'sproud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened.Y'know he's really upset about it.
Monica: What did you do to his sweater vests?
Monica: Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)
Monica: Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to LasVegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Monica: (answering it) Hello?
Monica: Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Monica: Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room?Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Monica: Go!!
Monica: Okay! Okay! Okay! (She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyoneclimbs off of Rachel.) We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Monica: (entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room) Oh, Phoebe,I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Monica: Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Monica: The Richard.
Monica: Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache? 
Monica: It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up havinglunch with him.
Monica: Really?
Monica: The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but Ididn't feel anything at all!
Monica: Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. Ijust don't want anything to spoil that.
Monica: I know.
Monica: What?
Monica: It's almost our anniversary!
Monica: I got you a present!
Monica: I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)

Monica: Oh that's okay. Dont worry about it, you can give it to me when weget back.
Monica: Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted togo for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get madand I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Monica: Really?!
Monica: Great!
Monica: Phoebe, you don't eat animals. 
Monica: Who are you talking too?
Monica: I'm so sorry.
Monica: I knew you were not okay with that.
Monica: It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you nottrust me?
Monica: You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Monica: I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Monica: I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!

Monica: Okay!
Monica: Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Monica: That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
Monica: I think so too.
Monica: Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, somethingnew, something borrowed, and something blue.
Monica: You're so efficient. I love you! 
Monica: No-no-no! We need something old!

Monica: That's stealing!
Monica: Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
Monica: Yep, we wanna get married! 
Chandler and Monica: All right.
Monica: What are you doing?
Monica: No, only because that's the graduation song.
Monica: Are you sure you wanna do this?
Monica: Are you sure you wanna do this?
Monica: Whoa!
Monica: What are you guys doing here?
Monica: Why else would we be here?
Monica: This is insane!
Monica: What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youremarried everywhere.
Monica: Yeah!
Monica: Hey.
Monica: How do I tell Chandler that its too soon. Its gonna breakhis heart, hes not gonna think that I dont love him anymore.
Monica: Yes I do!
Monica: Oh hi! Hi! Yknow, we were just talking about bacon.
Monica: Rach! We werent gonna miss our friends getting married!
Monica: What are you guys gonna do?
Monica: So, what do you think we should do?
Monica: I know I love you! (They hug.)
Monica: Thats a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dicedecide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Monica: All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 wedont get married.
Monica: Okay. (They approach the craps table.)
Monica: Ready?
Monica: (sarcastic) Come on eight.
Monica: Wow! I cant believe I actually rolled an eight.
Monica: Wait a minute. That wasnt a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hardeight.
Monica: I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?
Monica: Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up tofate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be aclear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandlerand Monica standing side-by-side holding each others hands.)
Monica: That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Monica: He took my snack!
Monica: Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad.
Monica: This doesnt mean anything, does it?
Monica: Okay.
Monica: No, dont say it! Dont even think it!
Monica: Im sick of the signs! Its too fast, Im happy the waythings are!
Monica: I dont want things to change! Do you?
Monica: All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everythingstays the same! And you go unpack because its been three days and its drivingme insane!
Monica: Then all your stuff would be here.
Monica: Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean itdoesnt make any sense.
Monica: Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Monica: YES!!!!!!!!
Monica: Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Monica: Heres your key (Gets him one.)
Monica: Heres your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go outand come back in!
Monica: Ready!
Monica: Wait! Oh my God! I cant get out!
Monica: No, its not a sign! Its a very old key!
Monica: Oh my God its old!
Monica: I love you!
Monica: No.
Monica: Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?
Monica: Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out? 
Monica: Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have toget it over with! Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.Okay? Thats it.
Monica: Pretty much.
Monica: Hi!
Monica: Joey, we have something to tell you.
Monica: Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Monica: Hey Pheebs! 
Monica: Hey, have you seen Rachel?
Monica: I have some pretty exciting news!
Monica: No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Monica: Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)
Monica: Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could youplease try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesnt seem so bad?(Exits.)
Monica: Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
Monica: I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe andshes the only one left!
Monica: No.
Monica: Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and Iare going to live together, here.
Monica: Really?!
Monica: Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correcther.)
Monica: Yeah, hes gonna work on that.
Monica: (singing) Well be waiting for you
Monica: Soon! I-I just couldnt before. You saw how upset Joey got! Icouldnt do that to her, shes my best friend!
Monica: Im not your best friend?
Monica: All right, all right, at least Im prepared.
Monica: (slapping his hand) Hey!
Monica: These arent for you! Are you upset?
Monica: Rach, theres something uh, important I have to tell you.
Monica: No! But, Im throwing this shirt away! I think there was a littlemisunderstanding before.
Monica: Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, livetogether we meant alone together.
Monica: Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasnt clear! Imreally sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? Theresabsolutely no rush.
Monica: Okay. Dont you want a cookie?
Monica: Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Monica: I made them!
Monica: (entering) Hi.
Monica: So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Monica: Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnt cry. Shewasnt angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)
Monica: I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion! Is that toomuch to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as youguys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Dont I deserve a few tears?!! I meanwe-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Monica: Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up ourstuff.
Monica: Yknow, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the longprocess of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Monica: Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh?Who-who gets this? See, I dont know if I want it because it might be yknow,too many memories!
Monica: I dont know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey,Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Monica: Something to remember me by!
Monica: But still, its a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Monica: Im fine! I just, Im thinking how much its an end ofera.
Monica: An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it wassignificant to me, maybe it wasnt significant to you!
Monica: What is the matter with you?!! Why arent you more upset?!Arent you gonna be sad that were not gonna be living together anymore?! I meanarent you gonna miss me at all?!
Monica: Whats hard to believe?
Monica: Rachel, its going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
Monica: No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isnt something that wejust, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. Andit is going to happen.
Monica: Yeah, sweetie.
Monica: No.
Monica: Im gonna miss you! (They hug.)
Monica: I know!
Monica: Whos Denise?
Monica: Okay listen, yknow when you move in Rachels room is gonna beempty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Monica: Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? Witha mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we couldhave a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they lovedstaying here!! Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.
Monica: No.
Monica: Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talkabout it, but no.
Monica: I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. Thebeautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Monica: What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Monica: Are you mocking me?
Monica: Hi.
Monica: Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) Im sorry too.
Monica: Yeah! Oh yes!
Monica: Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think ofsomething to do with the room together.
Monica: Totally!
Monica: Oh good.
Monica: Changes?
Monica: Youre-youre-youre gonna bring the Barca Lounger overhere?
Monica: Well, its a set and they should probably stay together.
Monica: See now-now youre taking them away from their home.
Monica: Yeah-yeah, yknow what? Yeah, thats it-thats it,everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! Thats-thats what I said! Ohcome on, Chandler! Im talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesntmatch! Where is it gonna go?!
Monica: Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Monica: Ross, we can handle this.
Monica: Love is the best medicine.
Monica: Why do you do it?
Monica: Yes.
Monica: Thats very funny!
Monica: Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Monica: Yeah, no, me neither.
Monica: You still want to move in together right?
Monica: Ross didnt scare you?
Monica: Come here, I want to show you something!
Monica: This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you couldsee the TV and its still walking distance to the kitchen.
Monica: Okay!
Monica: Uh-hmm.
Monica: Oh my God! I love that!
Monica: Uh, no!!
Monica: This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.)
Monica: And its a magnet!
Monica: Hey Rach, arent these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?
Monica: Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Monica: (under her breath) That youre a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in adrawer.)
Monica: Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Phoebe thats crazy!
Monica: Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)
Monica: No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought somefor myself.
Monica: I loved them!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Howd the lecture go?
Monica: That youre not funny or sexy?
Monica: Yeah, but yknow we could sneak in and watch.
Monica: What the hell are you doing?!
Monica: (in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her R)
Monica: (normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I cant?! (To anexiting student in accent.) Top O the morning to ya laddies!
Monica: Gimme em!
Monica: You stole them from me!
Monica: Gimme them!
Monica: You just wanna each take one?
Monica: Why dont you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and peoplewill think youre, yknow, that youre adjusting to life in America.
Monica: I think you look fine.
Monica: Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Monica: Yes!
Monica: Youre kidding!
Monica: Ross!
Monica: Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?
Monica: Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Monica: Dont worry about it Phoebe, well absolutely do it.
Monica: Come on Chandler, come on! Itll give us great practice forwhen(realizes what shes about to say and changes)people with babies cometo visit.
Monica: Pheebs, hows it going?
Monica: Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandlerwith little baby girl Chandler.
Monica: What do you mean?
Monica: This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at therestaurant.
Monica: Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishingcompound.
Monica: I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front ofthe building, so I washed it.
Monica: And six others.
Monica: Yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same.
Monica: Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someones eye out!
Monica: Oh its so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being ableto put both legs over your head.
Monica: How are you still single?!
Monica: Good. What made you change your mind?
Monica: Damnit! Yknow this whole time we were concentrating on watchingthe babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)
Monica: And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing theclothes?
Monica: Joey, you know you dont actually have one.
Monica: All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.
Monica: The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own fora while!
Monica: Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got togo to the hospital.
Monica: Oh my God.
Monica: Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
Monica: But my apartment!
Monica: But the mess!
Monica: Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out.Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Monica: (entering from her room) Hey!
Monica: (thinks) Okay.
Monica: Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together withRachel we thought wed go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is movingin with Phoebe.
Monica: Its not your birthday.
Monica: Youre not dressed yet?! Were supposed to start having fun in15 minutes!
Monica: Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me thatyoure packed. 
Monica: (entering) Rachel, I need to borrowYoure not packed!!!!Youre not packed even a little bit!

Monica: (starting to cry) Oh God!
Monica: No.
Monica: Im gonna miss you so much.
Monica: I dont think theres anything.
Monica: Nope, shes perfect.
Monica: Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Monica: Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Monica: Yeah, well I dont think it really counts if you have to read themoff the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Monica: Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!
Monica: (on phone) Whats up?
Monica: Oh, put him on!
Monica: "Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Idbetter wash it and shrink it!"
Monica: "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hateRoss!"
Monica: Im not talking to her!
Monica: Well, maybe youre rightShe made fun of my phone pen!
Monica: Listen Rachel, I feel really bad aboutWhat are you doing? (Shesees that Rachel is unpacking.)
Monica: What?!
Monica: It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Monica: Because its my apartment!
Monica: How about, youre moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throwsthem into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packingthe same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants "No." and Monica chants"Yes.")
Monica: (entering) I am not!
Monica: No Phoebe I am mad!
Monica: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. Im just gonna labelit, "What were you thinking?"
Monica: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Yknow I-I-I said somereally bad stuff about her, but yknow Rachel has some good qualities thatmake her a good roommate.
Monica: Yknow she has 147,000 pairs of boots
Monica: She lets you borrow them.
Monica: Do you wanna live outside?! Because its gettin cold! (ToPhoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, shell fold down the pages of the thingsshe thinks that Id like.
Monica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Monica: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with ablanket.
Monica: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she wasreally supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. Andnow you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
Monica: Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to itto get a better look.) Oh my God!
Monica: Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Monica: Im really gonna miss you.
Monica: Thanks.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Bye.
Monica: She really left.
Monica: Thank you.
Monica: Can I ask you a question?
Monica: What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dogsitting in the living room.)
Monica: Hey!
Monica: (jumps over a box) Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to thefloor!
Monica: Oh, So you can move them!
Monica: It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Monica: Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Monica: Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
Monica: Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Monica: Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate.It-it'll be way too complicated. 
Monica: Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in suchclose quarters, it could be trouble.
Monica: (chuckles) Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Monica: Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Monica: So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Monica: Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Monica: I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Monica: We'll see.
Monica: (on phone) Hi!
Monica: Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself.Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight. 
Monica: It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'mgonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Monica:  Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
Monica: What?!
Monica: Why is Ross naked?
Monica: Naked?
Monica: Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Monica: Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sinkin the bathroom. Bye!
Monica: Is it okay for me to come in now?
Monica: Why is everything different?
Monica: Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even getme started on the refrigerator magnets.
Monica: It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something? 
Monica: Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's awonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I wanteverything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Monica: Of course!
Monica: All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloveson) Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Monica: Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Monica: Hey guys.
Monica: It was okay. Shes still kind of depressed because she broke up withher boyfriend.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Monica: I dont think mine likes me either.
Monica: We should go.
Chandler and Monica: Hey.
Monica: What happened to your teeth.
Monica: Well, I think I shouldnt look directly at them.
Monica: Ross theyre really, really, really white.
Monica: How much longer?
Monica: Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Monica: She will be after tonight.
Monica: Oh my god.
Monica: My God, Rachel, I cant believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.Ohh, Im so jealous. (Chandler looks at her.)
Monica: Chandler, please, come on. Look at him. (Pointing to a picture of Ralph ona magazine,.)
Monica: (Holding a shirt in front of Ross.) Okay, maybe this will make your teethlook less white. (Ross has a big smile.) Nope. Okay, colors that dont work are blue,yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Monica: Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldnt look sobright.
Monica: Im just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Monica: Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Monica: Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Monica: All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
Monica: Now are drawers will smell nice and we didnt waste these pantyhose.
Monica: Wait, were supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Monica: You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. Youre right,Im sorry.
Monica: Yeah. Go over to Joeys. Go over to Joeys and drink some beerand hammer up some drywall.
Monica: When girls hang out, we dont have pillow fights in our underwear.(Chandler gets a hurt look on his face.) Im sorry. We do. We do. I dont knowwhy I said that.
Monica: Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Monica: Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because Im going to teach you tomake a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Monica: (on phone) Okay, great!  Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) Soguess whos coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Monica: (not amused by Chandlers joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, myparents.
Monica: Yeah, and yknow, if you could not mention to them that we livetogether, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking wewould eat around four.
Monica: Because they dont know were dating. (Again, trying toquickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink andthe stove to cook.)
Monica: Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, justout of nowhere, I didnt.
Monica: (trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen aroundfour! Ill see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the livingroom.)
Monica: Well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you. Im sorry.
Monica: Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youre reallysarcastic, or that, yknow, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off yourclothes and throw them on the couch.
Monica: Look, I know that I shouldve told them. I know I shouldntcare what they think. Im sorry. 
Monica: You really think thatll work?
Monica: (hugging Chandler) I dont think youll ever get my parentsthat drunk! 
Monica: Nothing.
Monica: No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
Monica: Youre not gonna mess it up.
Monica: Well, its done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Monica: Whoa whoa whoa! Wherere you goin?
Monica: Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Monica: Youre not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, andyoure gonna eat here!
Monica: Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is itsChandler!
Monica: Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Monica: Yknow dad, Chandler is one of Rosss very best friends!
Monica: Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Monica: (shocked) What?
Monica: Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler)were trying to get Ross stoned!
Monica: Ross, I cant believe youd do that!
Monica: You! Its not like its a big deal! You-you dont stilldo it or anything!
Monica: Dad, please dont pick your teeth out here! Alright, and ifyoure gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the-
Monica: Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will!
Monica: Really?
Monica: Okay.
Monica: (faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joeysaid) Mmmm! Its good!
Monica: Its so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only onewhos eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.Especially Ross.
Monica: (again, lying) Im gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at itin the mirror, as I eat it.
Monica: Ross? Lets go.
Monica: Alright, you know what? Thats it. Youve had your chance.
Monica: (out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Monica: And Dad, yknow that mailman that you got fired? He didntsteal your Playboys! Ross did!
Monica: Ross hasnt worked at the museum for a year!
Monica: Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Monica: Well actually, I-I didnt eat mine. Its still in thebathroom.
Monica: Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about.Its about being with the people that you love.
Monica: Oh, here.
Monica: Aw, Im sorry sweetie that she doesnt feel the same way.
Monica: Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clarks New YearsRocking Eve?
Monica: Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching itsince I can remember!

Monica: Okay, here comes another camera.
Monica: If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of thoseplatforms. Theyve been taping those people up there all day.
Monica: Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put onunderpants?
Monica: Hey, see that snippy guy over there? Hes the one who decides whogets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Monica: Excuse me, sir, would it help if I werent wearing underpants?
Monica: Man, this sucks! Yknow if Mom and Dad dont see us on TVafter we made them so jealous, I mean, whos gonna be the losers then?
Monica: What?
Monica: Ross, we havent done the routine since middle school.
Monica: Was it really that good?
Monica: Okay, lets do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Monica: 5 6 7 8!
Monica: Yes! (They run over to a platform)
Monica: I know! Hey, you havent been practising the routine, have you?
Monica: Me too!
Monica: Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we dont wanna lookstupid!
Monica: Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find thepresents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Monica: We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the newMillennium, and the guy yelled CUT!
Monica: Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, bythe way, great thinking about catching me!
Monica: What? We could do it!
Monica: I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go. (She and Ross get up)
Monica: I cant do it! (Ross falls into Monicas room)
Monica: Honey, we have been through this before!
Monica: You serious?!
Monica: Really?!
Monica: Bye. (Janine exits.)
Monica: I am so glad you said cooks.
Monica: You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Monica: Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Monica: Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture shouldhave a history, a story behind it.
Monica: Its gotta be one of a kind. Yknow like umm, yknow uh,whats that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Monica: Im tellingIf you put that in her apartment youll neverhear the end of it.
Monica: I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always lookingfor a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? Ill make that pasta thingI was telling you about.
Monica: Joey, you dont have too!
Monica: Tomorrow!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Monica: What happened to Janine?
Monica: Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Monica: (loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?
Monica: Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We couldnot have been nicer to her!
Monica: Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Monica: (from the hallway) I do not like that woman!
Monica: I am loud!
Monica: Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Monica: (loudly) I know!!!
Monica: Well, Id like to but, (extremely quietly) Im not sure wehave time to go.
Monica: We owe you?!
Monica: We didnt give you any money! (Chandler is motioning,"No!")
Monica: Dont worry about it.
Monica: Absolutely!
Monica: Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)
Monica: (bursting in) I knew it!! Yknow, youre not so quietyourself, missy!
Monica: (steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Lets go! Rightnow!
Monica: (to Janine) Youd better hope I dont see you in the hallway!!(They exit.)
Monica: What did I tell you about the hall?!
Monica: Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
Monica: Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, Im glad we worked thingsout.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)
Monica: (hearing that) Thats it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt withthe garbage bag) Come on!
Monica: (chasing her) Youd better run! 
Monica: I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Monica: That didnt work on mom, its not going to work on us.
Monica: No.
Monica: Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Monica: (relieved) Its only you.
Monica: So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell astory?
Monica: Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Rachel and Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Okay, Ive got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date,who would it be?
Monica: Me neither.
Monica: What?!
Monica: (visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it,but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Monica: Its wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Monica: Thats a good idea. 
Monica: Do you know whats a bad idea?
Monica: Thats right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hearsomething?
Monica: Its coming from the living room.
Monica: (entering) Hey, you guys.
Monica: (laughing) Oh, dont you guys look cute. You guys makesuch a cute couple.
Monica: (laughing harder) Nothing, Im just trying to recreatesome of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when youpicked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Monica: (angrily) It wasnt funny at all! Why would you do that?Why didnt you pick me?
Monica: That is completely untrue. You think Im high maintenance? Okay,prove it. I want you to make a list and were going to go through it point by point!
Monica: (to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs hercoat and leaves, too.)
Monica: I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Monica: Im sick of Japanese. Were not going there.
Monica: All right.
Monica: No, thank you.
Monica: Joey, what are you doing?
Monica: Joey, do you work here?
Monica: Joey, whats going on. What didnt you tell us you work here?
Monica: So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a littlebit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Monica: Hah!
Monica: Well, then, Im okay with being high maintenance.
Monica: I am not high maintenance!
Monica: Why do I have to decide?
Monica: I cant be fair. Youre my boyfriend.
Monica: Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Monica: Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Monica: Do you want me to pick you?!
Monica: Continue.
Monica: All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision.
Monica: You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and its offensive towomen, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, youshould be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!Now let it go! The joke sucks! 
Monica: Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Monica: Hey, its Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why dont you tell them whatyou were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Monica: Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Monica: Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Monica: Ahhh! You are on my list.
Monica: (embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didnt even tell him to saythat. (They hug). All right youre off my list. 
Monica: (sits next to him) Phoebe, its okay that you dont want me tobe your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Monica: I pick you, Phoebe.
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Monica: (congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I cant work ifIm sick.
Monica: Im not sick!! I dont get sick! Getting sick is for weaklingsand for pansies! 
Monica: (wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.) 
Monica: I dont need a tissue! Im fine-d! 
Monica: Im fine-d. Im fine-d! Yknow, its a really hardword to say.
Monica: Rach? (Points to Jill.)
Monica: You bought a boat?
Monica: Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Lets do somethingcrazy!
Monica: Okay, Ill rest. But yknow if Im going to bed, thenyoure coming with me.
Monica: (wiping her nose) Are you saying that you dont wanna get withthis? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesnt work all that well with thebig robe.)
Monica: (in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)
Monica: Im with you Chandler! I mean I cant have sex with a sickperson either, thats disgusting! But Im not sick! Let me prove it to you. Weare two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Monica: (still sick) Chandler!
Monica: (trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Monica: How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Monica: Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that Im not sick! Iwanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.) 
Monica: Im fine. (She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughingfits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)
Monica: (entering) Chandler, I think Im sick.
Monica: Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on mychest? (She hands him some of that Vicks Vap-O-Rub to put on.)
Monica: Come on! I really need your help!
Monica: Fine, Ill rub it on myself.
Monica: Yeah?
Monica: Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Monica: I cant believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Monica: Not now, Im sick!
Monica: What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Monica: Okay, if you really wanna have sex
Monica: Worked like a charm.
Monica: (calling from the bathroom) Is someone there?
Monica: (entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Rosssapartment) Is that your sister?
Monica: God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Monica: Oh no its not, no its not. Its a first date. Im surethat nothing is gonna(as she is talking we see Ross close his drapes.)
Monica: Joey we know you steal our food.
Monica: (To Rachel) Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Monica: (crying) This is my favorite part.
Monica: Chandler theres nothing wrong with crying! I mean you donthave to be so macho all the time.
Monica: Yeah youre right. I dont know what I was thinking.
Monica: Oh, Ive got it! I have got it! (Gets up and gets something fromthe dresser underneath the TV.) Pictures from your childhood. This will get you goinggood!
Monica: Where were your parents?
Monica: Poor thing!
Monica: Youre jealous of Princess Caroline?
Monica: (noticing the bag Joeys carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Monica: Guys, whats going on?
Monica: Thats Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Monica: This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, yknow shehad such a terrible childhood.
Monica: Yes, but you are dead inside.
Monica: Wh-what, why?
Monica: Yeah youre right, we cantwe shouldnt watch this.
Monica: (hands the tape back to Joey, but doesnt let him grab it)Yknow maybe a little bit!
Monica: Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Monica: Hey sweetie!
Monica: (picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul? 
Monica: Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Monica: Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if youcant cry, I love you.
Monica: Stop it!
Monica: I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.(Points to her heart.)
Monica: Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it toyou in the delivery room and you dont cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take himto college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing,it wont matter to me.
Monica: And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And youre writing outmy eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I willalways be with you," and you still cant shed one tiny tear, I know youllbe crying a river inside.
Monica: What is wrong with you?!!!
Monica: What?! You cant shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you anote from the beyond!
Monica: No you robot!!
Monica: No, I havent.
Monica: (To Chandler) Shhhh!!!
Monica: Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Monica: Bye.
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: Why did they get divorced?
Monica: And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldnt bedating me, thats for sure.

Monica: Thanks.
Monica: Oh no! Whats the matter?
Monica: Okay.

Monica: No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all ofyour fan mail and stuff!
Monica: Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
Monica: Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: (gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see thather long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug,which is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!

Monica: Youre on the phone!
Monica: Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.)
Monica: Oh well, its not so bad. 
Monica: Joey! Hes working! (To Chandler) You would look good inthat.
Monica: Isnt that mine?
Monica: (pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Wow! So, now youre going on a date with this girl?
Monica: Youre right, Im sorry. Its not like youreyknow, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Monica: You dated her!
Monica: All right, well why dont I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joeya favor?!
Monica: Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Monica: I know! Now look, theres only one problem though. Theresonly room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys.
Monica: So Rach! Youre the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, youlljust have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bringthem to you, yknow, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Monica: Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Monica: Does that smell bother you?
Monica: Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie tocover it.
Monica: Okay!
Monica: Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) Its foryou. Its the fire inspector.

Monica: Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen!There arent any message youve forgotten to give me are there? (Chandler has adisgusted look on his face.) Apparently youre not very good at it! I
Monica: Yknow what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a padwith me when I go answer the phone just in case (Chandler gets that disgusted lookback.) Okay
Monica: You had no right to go out with him.
Monica: You sold me out.
Monica: Yes you did.  You absolutely sold me...
Monica: Did you just flick me?
Monica: Fine!
Monica: (To Chandler) You are going to make a joke about my specialpresent! Why would you do that?!
Monica: I think our lovers spat will start a little early this month.
Monica: We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Monica: Ross!!
Monica: How crazy that wed run into you!
Monica: (obviously attracted to him) Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Phoebe and Monica: (sympathetic) Ohh!
Monica: Yknow, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day,cause usually hes got the childrens hospital.
Monica: And hes a great brother!
Monica: Ohh!
Monica: No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Monica: You said the baby.
Monica: Why would the little girl creep you out?
Monica: What?! Excuse me!
Monica: How was your first day?
Monica: Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.
Monica: No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controlsC.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Monica: Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.
Monica: Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Monica: Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, Ill just write about Phyllis!Hmm!
Monica: (writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Monica: (still writing) Phyllis sees what Im doing.
Monica: Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Monica: We said six!
Monica: Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this,"Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"
Monica: Ugh!
Monica: What time?
Monica: Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Monica: Hi!
Monica: Oh thats great!
Monica: I mean think about all the money that youre gonna make!
Monica: Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
Monica: Oh, I love museums!
Monica: Soakin up all the culture.
Monica: Where do you want to start?
Monica: Yeah!
Monica: This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but Iwouldnt put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!(Points to both places.) I mean youd have the ceremony under this big beautifularch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.) 
Monica: What?! Are you crazy?! Im not getting married! Im not evenengaged.
Monica: Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Monica: Phoebe, that stuff is
Monica: Hi, honey.
Monica: What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Monica: Oh no!
Monica: Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!
Monica: NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Monica: Phoebe!
Monica: Have you seen Chandler?!
Monica: The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellationand that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! (Phoebe gasps.) I know! How badis this?!
Monica: I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I cant find himanywhere!
Monica: Well, Im never gonna listen to you again, thats for sure!(Mimicking her.) "Yknow, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Monica: Well Rachels not here! (Runs out.)
Monica: (going over to him) Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Monica: Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our namesdown for fun! I mean, whats the harm in that?
Monica: Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebeand Rachel
Monica: It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, becauseit doesnt.
Monica: Really?
Monica: I know! I know.
Monica: Im gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that youre back. I wasreally worried about you. (Exits.)
Monica: Still crying?
Monica: Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And oneof them is sex.
Monica: I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one. Imjust saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.
Monica: Oh, we have some
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Whats the big deal?
Monica: Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is thisrelationship going?
Monica: Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Monica: Hi guys.
Monica: Oh, thank you! (The gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wearsknowing glances.) (Monica giggles.) Whats going on?
Monica: What are you doing?
Monica: Are you okay?
Monica: Yeah. Im okay. Im actuallyIm a little cold, canI have your jacket?
Monica: (laughs) Are you sure youre okay?
Monica: Ohh thats sweet!
Monica: (interrupting him) Oh my God!
Monica: Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richards back.)
Monica: Oh God, maybe he wont see us. Richard!
Monica: Hey, its good to see you!
Monica: YeahOh thats right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, Isee you got your mustache back.
Monica: Chandler, wh-why dont we sit down?
Monica: (to Richard) Its good to see you
Monica: And so, were hiding in the bathroom.
Monica: So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know theyre goingat it right on the bathroom floor.
Monica: Ohh.
Monica: I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Monica: Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just cant getout of!
Monica: Why dont you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationshipagainst the bad stuff. I mean thats what I did when I first (looks at Chandler andpauses) weighing stuff.
Monica: If the school finds out youre fired.
Monica: Shes leaving for three months.
Monica: Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see afuture?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses inconsideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didnt you?!
Monica: Okay well I thinkthats your answer.
Monica: Why do you want to see my hand?
Monica: (suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebes wishes.)
Monica: (entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiotkeeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Monica: (entering) Hi guys!
Monica: What are you up too?
Monica: Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hearthat youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Monica: Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! Todeclare your love for one another to the world!
Monica: Okay well thats good to know.
Monica: Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)
Monica: Richard!
Monica: Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back tocomplement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So whats up?
Monica: Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Monica: What uhWhat did youWhat?!
Monica: Yknow youre really not supposed to be back here!
Monica: Oh God (Starts looking around.) Why dont they put chairsback here?!
Monica: What the Yes youre too late! Where was all this three yearsago?!
Monica: What were you doing in Africa?
Monica: Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I Im sorry butumm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Monica: Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, infact, Im the one thats making him wait!
Monica: Yeah!
Monica: Why? Because of the government.
Monica: So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dontreally believe that do you?
Monica: Yeah, but thats pigs not people!
Monica: Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may neverwant to get married?
Monica: Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Monica: Yknow what?! I gotta go! Ugh! 
Monica: Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Monica: Yeah, its great.
Monica: Im just having one of those days where you realize youre ina dead-end relationship!
Monica: Its not like I want to get married tomorrow! Its just thatI-Id like to believe that Im in a relationship thats actually goingsomewhere, that Im not just wasting my time!
Monica: No I dont know Chandler! Not anymore! Its like itslike somethings changed.
Monica: I didnt change!
Monica: What?!
Monica: Is that some kind of boat talk?
Monica: What does he think? Does he think Im just gonna wait around fornothing?
Monica: (starts for the door) Well theres some people who do want to marryme.
Monica: Yeah! Richard!
Monica: Thats right.
Monica: You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that hes a-a complexfellow whos unlikely to take a wife! That-that hes against marriage and alwayswill be!
Monica: Hi.
Monica: I dont know why Im here.
Monica: I dont know.
Monica: (entering) Chandler is such an idiot!
Monica: Yeah, Ill have a scotch
Monica: (moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?
Monica: No thats, thats okay.
Monica: Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Monica: Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I dont like my neweye doctor.
Monica: Edward Nevski?
Monica: No.
Monica: But getting over was the hardest thing that Ive ever had to do.And I never let myself think about you.
Monica: (to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Monica: Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.
Monica: I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-ups apartment!Yknow, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Monica: Yknow, lets face it, Im not a kid anymore! I-I need tobe with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of workand telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I dontwant that!
Monica: Fair? Please dont even talk to me about fair! Fair wouldvebeen you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair wouldve been Chandler wanting tomarry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Monica: Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looksup at his eyes.) I dont knUmm. I dont know. Umm
Monica: Yknow, I-I I have to figuresome stYknow,some stuff before I can
Monica: You wanted it to be a surprise.
Monica: Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky.(Starting to cry.) As tofall in love with my bestmy best Theres areason why girls dont do this!
Monica: Yes.
Monica: I knew you were likely to take a wife!

Monica: Yeah, but I dont think we have time.
Monica: (lustily) Lets do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto thebed.)
Monica: (chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-youwere probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!
Monica: Phoebe!
Monica: Phoebe! Come on! Lets go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebeenters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why arent you dressed yet?!
Monica: (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, Ill tell you what, ifyou get ready now Ill let you play it at the wedding.
Monica: Fair enough, now go get ready!
Monica: Ill get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebratingmy(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.)Im sorry, uh apparently Ive opened the door to the past.
Monica: (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
Monica: See, Ive been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike somepeople Im only planning on doing this once. So, uh yknow, maybe this isselfish and Im sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be aboutthat.
Monica: No its not! No! No! Now its about you and Ross getting backtogether!
Monica: See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Monica: Thats true.
Monica: Thunder being stolen!!
Monica: Well, were still talking about it, arent we?
Monica: Yes that would be lovely.
Monica: Yknow what? I-I think that umm, I dont feel like going to ThePlaza.
Monica: No-no, I-I really dont want to talk about it! I dont! (ToRachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)
Monica: I cant believe her, yknow its justits sotypical.

Monica: My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousinCharlie.
Monica: Its all everybody at the party could talk about!
Monica: (gasps) We had a characturist!
Monica: And yet, here we are doing it again.
Monica: Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Monica: I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Monica: Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Monica: I dont know! I dontmaybe youre feeling a littleresentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought youd get married first! Maybe you cantstand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Monica: (yelling after them) I cant believe youre gonna have sex onmy engagement night!!
Monica: (outside the door) Its Monica, open up!
Monica: I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope thatyou guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce yourengagement Im going to announce that Im pregnant!
Monica: I know why!
Monica: Okay! Why?!
Monica: What do you mean?
Monica: (starting to cry) Im sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.(They hug.)
Monica: (entering from her room) Oww!
Monica: I dont know, my hand feels weird. I guess its because,Im engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?
Monica: Okay! (Runs off.)
Monica: (returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3" 3-ring binder on the table.)
Monica: This baby has got everything. Take yknow, locations for instance.(She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, thengeographically, then by square footage. 
Monica: All right, so I havent cleared the budget with my parents yet, buttell me how this is for music.
Monica: All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Monica: A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing.Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Monica: Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Monica: Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Monica: Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)
Monica: Oh my God! Its like one mind.
Monica: Oh dad, really you dont need to
Monica: Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at yourfifth grade Halloween party.
Monica: Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well Iguess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.(Chandler and her laugh, but her parents dont.) What?
Monica: What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?
Monica: I dont believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
Monica: You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Monica: What about when I started dating Chandler?
Monica: I cant believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Monica: I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help payfor it?
Monica: My parents spent the money for our wedding!
Monica: No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swingband! No lilies!
Monica: How? I dont have any money.
Monica: How much?
Monica: Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Monica: Its enough for wedding scenario eight.
Monica: (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-theamount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Rachel and Monica: Ah, yeah!
Monica: This is the most special day of our lives.
Monica: Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding aparty one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could alwaysearn more money, okay? But uh, were only gonna get married once.
Monica: You-youre gonna have to put your foot down?
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Listen umm, Ive been thinking, its not fair for me to askyou to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard forthat.
Monica: Eh, you work for that.
Monica: You do?!
Monica: Oh, youre so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what aboutour, what about the future and stuff?
Monica: You thought about that?
Monica: How many kids were we gonna have?
Monica: What else did you think about?
Monica: (laughs) Yknow what? I-I dont want a big, fancy wedding.
Monica: No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Monica: Uh-hmm.
Monica: I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you weretalkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Monica: Oh good.
Monica: Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Monica: Yeah!
Monica: Of course! (She mouths, "I have no idea," to the rest of thegang.)
Monica: (interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we dontwant to deprive them of that joy.
Monica: Oh, I already have one. 
Monica: Hey, I know I what I want!
Monica: No, you dont want this. I want to have your grandmotherscookie recipe.
Monica: Uh-huh, yeah.
Monica: I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Monica: Okay. Im gonna be the mom that makes the worlds bestchocolate chip cookies.
Monica: Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Monica: What?
Monica: Wow! Thats great! Dad must really like you, he doesnt askjust anyone to play.
Monica: This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Monica: Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Monica: He hates to lose.
Monica: Whats wrong Phoebe?
Monica: No!! Why didnt you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof boxand keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Monica: (To Chandler) This is what happens when you dont register forgifts!
Monica: No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I dostuff like this at work all the time.
Monica: Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Monica: All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Monica: You dont? (Laughs) Well, thats the difference between aprofessional and a layman.
Monica: Hey! How was sailing?
Monica: Hey! How was it?
Monica: Oh my God Chandler! I cant believe it!
Monica: You gave my father a lap dance!
Monica: Listen, Im sure that dad doesnt care. He probably thoughtthis was funny; hell be telling this story for years!
Monica: I wasnt escaping.
Monica: I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Monica: (takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens)Im sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, Ill call youlater dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)
Monica: Okay, heres batch 22. Ohh, maybe thesell taste a little likeyour grandmothers. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Monica: Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in theninth grade.
Monica: No, just a Friday night.
Monica: The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Monica: Well, Ive tried everything. I give up. I guess Im not gonnabe the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duckconfit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.
Monica: Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers?Wouldnt they have the recipe?
Monica: What was her name?
Monica: Nestle Tollhouse?!
Monica: (grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is thisthe recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)
Monica: I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figureout the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Monica: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, its your mom.(Hands him the phone.)
Monica: Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Monica: And I have costumes.

Monica: Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story Ive had such acraving for them.
Monica: Ross!
Monica: No! No. Theyre umm Theyre just uhground beefsmileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)
Monica: Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
Monica: (trying not to laugh) Im not laughing. 
Monica: Youre right. I mean Im sorry. Yeah, I shouldnt belaughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandlerlaughing.)
Monica: (running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!
Monica: (To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Monica: Oh my God! (Laughing)
Monica: I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!
Monica: Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch GoldenGirls!
Monica: Its hard for some people!
Monica: Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Monica: Ohh, Im sorry I couldnt think of anymore for Ross!
Monica: Yknow, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni andvery little glue.
Monica: No!
Monica: I dont know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What areyou laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)
Monica: Yeah?
Monica: Ohh, absolutely.
Monica: Yeah, definitely!
Monica: Then, Id steer clear of Phoebe.
Monica: Whats the matter?
Monica: Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement inthe local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us.
Monica: Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!
Monica: (looking at one) Oh, heres a great one.
Monica: I know, but look at me all tan.
Monica: Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines!Yknow (Does the whole hair blowing in the wind model type poses.)
Monica: Chandler what do you say?
Monica: Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have abeautiful smile.
Monica: Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.) Allright, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets tryumm, try looking sexy.
Monica: Or not.
Monica: I know. Lets try a lookof far offwonderment. Okay,well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and thedays to come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the matter with yourface?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married,"not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" (The photographer laughs.) Hey!Dont laugh at him! Hes my drowning moron!
Monica: Thats it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
Monica: They cant all be bad. (To Chandler) Find the one where you makeyour bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Monica: Do you really want to pull at that thread?
Monica: (seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!
Monica: Are you okay?
Monica: What?!
Monica: Chandler, what were you thinking?
Monica: Chandler?
Monica: Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Monica: Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.)
Monica: Yeah, we really do!
Monica: Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Monica: Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because Ihave been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Monica: First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both soimportant to me
Monica: Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system wherewe trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe weremine
Monica: If Phoebe were my maid of honor
Monica: Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we allget to do it once and no one would get upset.
Monica: (laughs) Well thats the best part. Umm, you guys get todecide!
Monica: Because then I dont have to!
Monica: Im really not deciding!
Monica: Yeah thats right.
Monica: Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This womanoverheard that I was marrying you and-and then sheshe wished me good luck.
Monica: No, its more like a (sarcastically) good luck.
Monica: She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Monica: Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Monica: What are you doing?
Monica: Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Monica: Did you break up with her?
Monica: Why?
Monica: Fat?!
Monica: You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Monica: Well, apparently she does.
Monica: Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who youare!
Monica: Youre Lewis Posin.
Monica: Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one dayI asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Monica: No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa. (Chandler emerges,without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad asI did in fifth grade! Yknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Monica: No, I know. But yknow what? It would make me feel better if Lewisapologized to me.
Monica: Its pretty clear.
Monica: Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnthave to apologize.
Monica: All right, II have to ask.
Monica: Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Monica: Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she havegained?
Monica: In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! Thats notthe point.
Monica: Well Thats not the only time this was an issue. You rememberwhen umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Monica: How?
Monica: What if I have babies, okay? I mean Im gonna look different.Im okay with that, but Im not sure that you are!
Monica: Keep going.
Monica: Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Monica: I love you. (They hug and kiss.)
Monica: (entering) Hey, whats going on?
Monica: (gasps) Ohh, wow! Thats great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! Wereally have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We shouldprobably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; wellget together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? Im so excited! (Runs outleaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)
Monica: She sent the chicken back again?!
Monica: Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Monica: (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns aroundto face the planets most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford ofcourse. Shes the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.
Monica: Im fine.
Monica: Oh Uh
Monica: Well, she saw the ring.
Monica: Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were mostpeople.
Monica: Well, she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself, named Clark. Uh,she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Monica: Huh?
Monica: Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, whatwas I supposed to do?!
Monica: Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it wont be so bad.
Monica: Oh my God, shes not gonna like the chicken that night either isshe?!
Monica: Really?
Monica: So-so you wouldve just lied?
Monica: Would it really have been that easy?
Monica: Good, so do it Saturday night because were going to dinner withher and Clark.
Monica: He might still show up.
Monica: Is that all?
Monica: Its actually going to be just family.
Monica: What are we gonna do?
Monica: Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Monica: (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice arent they?
Monica: Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Monica: Well justwell just let her stay.
Monica: Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Monica: I never stop thinking about it.
Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Monica: Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Monica: Thats right. Thats right. And that is why you cantstay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding.
Monica: I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but youcan.
Monica: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, sotechnically I didn't lose. 
Monica: Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (Thats true in so many ways, trustme, Ive lived in one and been to the other.)
Monica: 'Cause you invited your assistant. 
Monica: Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potatostuffed pumpkin. 
Monica: Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) butI still do.
Monica: All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please,watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food! 
Monica: (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your ovendoesn't work? 
Monica: Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? 
Monica: Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket) 
Monica: Rosss apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here moreoften? 
Monica: That's my pie! 
Monica: Uh-oh! Uh-oh! 
Monica: We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looksout) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog! 
Monica: Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? 
Monica: Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! 
Monica: Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monicasapartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand. 
Monica: I'll be right there! 
Monica: (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up! 
Monica: Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic! 
Monica: Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had areaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? 
Monica: Don't do what? 
Monica: 1250.
Monica: Yeah. 
Monica: Really? I'd say 3 to 4. 
Monica: When it's your assistant, I would say never. 
Monica: Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-hesobviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.  What he needs right now is for you to be his friend. 
Monica: Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now. 
Monica: Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Monica: Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back toClunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her! 
Monica: That's not gonna work. 
Monica: Hey! I didn't know either. 
Monica: Yeah, I knew. 
Monica: Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! 
Monica: Hi, honey. 
Monica: What? Why, why would... 
Monica: That's right, she came back all by herself. 
Monica: Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took meto the park, I got it, andit bent.
Monica: Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Monica: Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Monica: Im gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table)on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Monica: See? This is exactly why Im making this candy. We can learntheir names and get to know our neighbors.
Monica: Where you can make out with your assistant.
Monica: Oh yeah, whats the plan?
Monica: Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Monica: Did you two
Monica: Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire
Monica: Okay.
Monica: The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Monica: Joey!! 
Monica: Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Monica: They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!! (Starts todo so.)
Monica: Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Monica: (turning a light on) Who is that?!
Monica: Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Monica: Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Monica: Umm, listen I am sorry, but Ill put some out first thing in themorning.
Monica: Um-hmm.
Monica: Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard thestory, I almost cried.
Monica: Oh yeah! I saw her walkin it down the street the other day. Shehad uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Monica: Umm, can we see you ride it?
Monica: See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! Andhere is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did youhear that Chandler? No such thing!
Monica: Im sorry, I cant help you. See? (Points to her new sign.)Rules are rules.
Monica: No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell em?
Monica: Some people have been saying its yknow little drops of heaven, butwhatever.
Monica: (still talking to the woman) All right, Ill do it just this once!But you cant tell anybody!
Monica: (closing the door) Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe thatsign didnt work!
Monica: Hmm?
Monica: But they like it!
Monica: Maybe.
Monica: Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funnyman? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)
Monica: Well, theyre just gonna have to wait arent they? Iveonly got two hands!!
Monica: No! You dont know the system! Therell be nobody messing withthe system!
Monica: (opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; Ijust need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
Monica: (To Chandler) Thank you.
Monica: Did you smoke?
Monica: Im fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean,someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Monica: Betrothed (Corrects him)
Rachel and Monica: Hi!
Monica: (Offering Ross the skull) Licorice?
Monica: Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Monica: No.
Monica: About a half an hour.
Monica: No.
Monica: Bing's weird.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Monica: Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Monica: Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Monica: I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Monica: (pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money.
Monica: No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin you down.Everybody wants to be paid off.
Monica: You've got to be smooth about it.
Monica: How did it go?
Monica: It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand andgive him the money!
Monica: I don't know.
Monica: We'd be eating our soup right now.
Monica: (sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick!Give him the money and get their table!
Monica: It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticksin the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is soannoying.
Monica: Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna livethere anymore?
Monica: What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Monica: Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the wayfromTexas.
Monica: Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Monica: Come on Ben.
Monica: Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, theArmadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thoughtI'd say.
Monica: (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has areally teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
Monica: Yes, is that okay?
Monica: No.
Monica: What are you talking about?
Monica: You were invited?!
Monica: My God, I cant believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad wereinvited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I wereinseparable!
Monica: Yeah, well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kidsher precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadnthave stopped her, there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go too.
Monica: Joey, that papers like a year old!
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!
Monica: (disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! Thatsnot the reason shes not inviting me!
Monica: Joan?
Monica: Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasnt invited andyou got "and guest?!"
Monica: Wait a minute, yknow, youre bringing me!
Monica: Why not?!
Monica: Because! Shes my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! Werefamily yknow? Well thats important to me.
Monica: (laughs) Well see.
Monica: David who?
Monica: Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Monica: What are you doing?
Monica: So! Hell understand!
Monica: God, you are so strong.
Monica: Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut. (To the couplesitting to her right.) Hi!

Monica: Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didntget invited! A blood relative! Blood!!

Monica: Okay, youre fine.
Monica: Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me? (Starts toget up and great Frannie.)
Monica: Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them tomom.
Monica: Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do youlike that?!
Monica: You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?!WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?!(Frannies husband walks up.) Stuart!
Monica: Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Monica: (looking up) Ross, whens this comet thing start?
Monica: Okay, weve been out here for two hours and we havent seenany stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandlers getting chilly. (She walks overto where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)
Monica: Shes sleeping.
Monica: Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon iswhats going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Monica: It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one willkick you in the shin.
Monica: With a wok? (Chandlers holding a wok.) I thought you were going toread my boring book to put you asleep.
Monica: Here, let me make the milk, Im up anyway.
Monica: Okay that does sound like fun. 
Monica: The second sister dies?!
Monica: The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
Monica: Okay, heres your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She seesthat Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)
Monica: Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? Im sorry. Here. (Hands themug of milk to him.)
Monica: Are you still awake?
Monica: You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesntrespond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as were both up
Monica: What?! What are you doing?!
Monica: Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Monica: Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked meworld! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)
Monica: What?!
Monica: Okay. Okay, Im ready. Come on big fella!
Monica: Give me the good stuff.

Monica: Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!
Monica: (entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So, I was checking out theuh, real estate section
Monica: Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.)
Monica: I cant believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Monica: Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you,its time the velvet ropes came down.
Monica: Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! Igotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victorias Secret catalogues, not agym!
Monica: As much as they love you?
Monica: Hey!

Monica: Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All ofthe memories
Monica: I used to love to play restaurant.

Monica: Wow! Look at this! (Picking up a shirt.) I cant believe I even fitinto this shirt! (She holds it up and it reads: Tyrannosaurus Ross.) (She turns it aroundand looks at it.) Oh, this is yours. (Hands it to Ross.)
Monica: (holding up a small cowboy hat) This isnt mine. (Sets it down andlooks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey, this isnt, this isnt my stuff! Ugh,Ross! (Grabs and holds up a doll.) These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Monica: What?
Monica: Just mine?
Monica: So why-why wasnt Rosss stuff ruined? (Pause) And if you saythe words medical marvel Im going to Easy Bake your head!
Monica: So wait, Rosss stuff is fine, but I have no memories because youwanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Monica: I cant believe this! (Storms out.)
Monica: Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. (Shepicks up some kind of furry thing.) It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and Idont even know what it is! Ohh, its still soft. (She rubs it against hercheek.) What do you think this is?
Monica: How do you think I am?! Youve wrecked all my childhood memories.You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!

Monica: I cant believe you bought this.
Monica: All right Rach, for what its worth, I think that youre doinggreat. I mean yknow lets face it, no one handles this well.
Monica: Werent you asked to leave sonny?

Its okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can doanything I want! Because I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filmingthe fall.)
Monica: Phoebe, yknow why dont we just go upstairs and have somebirthday cake?
Monica: Oh man!

Monica: Wafer thin ice!
Monica: So to get this part you cant be?

Monica: But you told them you werent?
Monica: Wow! Wow! And its definitely all gone? Theres nothing thereto work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?
Monica: Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learningtogrow a turtleneck!
Monica: Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Monica: Unless!
Monica: Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Monica: Well Im not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head Imthinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Well uh, Im trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if Iraid your fridge?
Monica: Okay. (Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that wont work.Cheese? (Picks it up) That wont work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up) I hope thatwont work.
Monica: No its umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, Im gonna go guys. 
Monica: I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!(Runs out.)
Monica: Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you totry on.
Monica: Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one ismade of bologna. (Points.)
Monica: Oh, just until the glue dries.
Monica: (to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable. 
Monica: Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which isnice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know its gonna shrink.
Monica: I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, thats really justfor me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why dont you go into your room andtry these on and well seeget a better idea of whats gonna work.
Monica: Toothpick?
Monica: What are you trying on now?
Monica: And?
Monica: Joey!
Monica: What?! Which one?!
Monica: Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly needme for on such short notice! (She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachelsitting on the couch.) Oh.
Monica: For what?
Monica: You al-you already had it?
Monica: Well no wait a minute thats not true! No, what did, that wasreally sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Monica: Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! Imean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talkto people I dont even like!
Monica: Wait a minute, she isnt Shes not the one who you
Monica: Wow!
Monica: (To Joey) They were lovers.
Monica: (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay so this is where theband is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins havepeoples names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) AndRach, here you are. (Points to Rachels place.)
Monica: (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones areyours.
Monica: Chandler, relax its not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not aclose one.
Monica: Okay, I think thats it. The seating chart is done. This is ourwedding. They all look like theyre having fun dont they?
Monica: Oh! (Gets up) Lets see, wellif this is the wedding hall thenumm (Walks away) youre parents will be at home in Queens.
Monica: Why would they think theyre invited?
Monica: Joey!
Monica: Rosss parents are my parents!
Monica: Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Monica: All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do somerearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Monica: Hey. Oh good-good youre here! All right, I figured it out.Im gonna take two tables of eight, Im gonna add your parents, and Imgonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added twoextra meals, we are good to go!

Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn postoffice! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, theUS Post Office? No, more like US lost office!

Monica: What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Monica: 007 has a fancy car!
Monica: 007 gets all the ladies.

Monica: Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Monica: No! But I know exactly what Im going to say.
Monica: (handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Lets just do it right now.Okay? It wont be hard. Just say whats in your heart. (She goes back, sitsdown, and starts feverishly writing.)
Monica: You have to help me! Im supposed to be writing my vows and all Ihave is this! (Shows them what shes been working on.)
Monica: Thank you.
Monica: Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)
Fat Monica: Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.

Monica: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Monica: Well?
Monica: (Comes up for below the covers andlooks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica notknowing what to say.)
Monica: Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)

Monica: I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
Monica: What?
Monica: You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Monica: Yes, you did!
Monica: You love me!
Monica: Then all your stuff would be here.
Monica: Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean itdoesnt make any sense.

Monica: Honey, Im going to put my hand in your pocket!
Monica: No.
Monica: What?!
Monica: Oh that is so sweet!
Monica: Yes.
Monica: Whats the matter?
Monica: Well, are you going to be able to do this?
Monica: Well, the good news is, I dont think anyones looking at us.
Monica: (seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.
Monica: Honey, Im not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someoneelse.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)
Monica: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
Monica: This is so huge.
Monica: Of course not nothing is. Between me and you
Monica: in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
Monica: How?
Monica: Well I-I talked to and uh, shes definitely going to have thisbaby. Yknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
Monica: Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard its gonna be.
Monica: Well, theres a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is shegoing to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realizeshes not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
Monica: Are you okay?
Monica: Oh really?!
Monica: (interrupting) Rachels really the one whos pregnant.
Monica: How do you feel?
Monica: Yes! Maybe its a false positive. Are you sure you peed on thestick right?
Monica: You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Oh, wait a minute! Whos is the father?!
Monica: Oh, come on its my wedding! That can be my present.
Monica: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
Monica: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youll be fine. (She startsto walk towards the floor.)
Monica: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you caneasily embarrass me. But come on, it doesnt matter. All right? I married you! So Iwant to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Justtry not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust amove.) There you go.
Monica: (entering) Did I miss it? (Phoebe nods no.) Rachel, I-I want you to knowthat, if its positive, were gonna
Monica: Go ahead Rach.
Monica: Well Well, great.
Monica: Oh God
Monica: Are you really gonna do this?
Monica: (depressed) Thats right. Im no longer a bride. Illnever be a bride again. Now, Im just someones wife!
Monica: Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)
Monica: Thats not til Thursday.
Monica: They wont be ready for weeks.
Monica: Thats true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Monica: Oh thanks. (Reading the bill) Champagne, strawberriesOh my God! Icant believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: No! (Pause) But, theyre callin out to me! I mean this littleguy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldntmind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
Monica: A tiny salt shaker!!!
Monica: Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
Monica: Good. Okay, Im just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest ofthem.
Monica: Whew. Although yknow, this is part of a salt and pepper set. Imean I guess yknow it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
Monica: Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)
Monica: Hey, how are you feelin? Any morning sickness?
Monica: No! Joey and Ross dont know anything and Chandler still thinksthat Phoebes pregnant.
Monica: Wow. Yknow it is so weird. I mean, youre gonna tell this guytoday and he has no idea whats gonna happen.
Monica: What was that bam?
Monica: Whos David Lynn?
Monica: No! No! I shouldnt have even opened these! I mean IJoey I amout of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what Ido, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
Monica: Give me one more.
Monica: Oh my God! Joey!
Monica: You cant marry him!
Monica: Phoebe!
Monica: Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the onewhos pregnant.
Monica: Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnt have a baby in ninemonths!
Monica: Theres a dude?
Monica: People have got to finish their stories!
Monica: (throwing up the last present) I dont know how any of these gotopened?!
Monica: I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never goingto trust me with anything ever again!
Monica: Yeah. What is that?
Monica: Hey! Howd it go?
Monica: So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
Monica: What?!
Monica: Great! Were hangin in the kitchen! (She drags him into thekitchen and turns his back to the living room) Lets stay in the kitchen!
Monica: Wow! That is a great picture!

Monica: That would be a good idea.
Monica: You kissed another woman!
Monica: Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)
Monica: Yeah I am!
Monica: Thats right. Get it out of your system while were alone.
Monica: Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldnt find though wasyour Speedo.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Thank you.
Monica: This is so great! And Im gonna be your babys aunt!
Monica: Yeah, but Im the only one related by blood.
Monica: Well, what were you gonna say?
Monica: Hey! Good luck!
Monica: Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross aregonna have a baby.
Monica: I didnt think you could keep it a secret.
Monica: Theyre kissing lets just go around them.
Monica: Im in love too! But in an orderly fashion.

Monica: And youve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
Monica: Yeah, definitely.

Monica: I paid to have this done.
Monica: Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!

Monica: Youre fired.
Monica: Yeah and-and Im sorry too. But, well I justI like thingsdone a certain way and the chemistrys just not right.
Monica: Tim wait!
Monica: Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-theres a learning curvewith this job and maybe we can try it again.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Hey you guys?
Monica: I know its last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
Monica: And everybody has to wear costumes. (And theres generaldisconcertment.) Come on! Itll be fun!
Monica: You have to!
Monica: So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
Monica: Wait! Youre supposed to wear a costume!
Monica: Oh. 
Monica: Im Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when youre toobig for it.
Monica: So we do Supergirl.
Monica: What?! I thought hed love it! His favorite kid's book was the VelveteenRabbit!
Monica: Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
Monica: You didnt dress up either?!
Monica: What?! Theres only been like four kids.
Monica: What are you supposed to be?
Monica: No, space doody!
Monica: Hey Joey?
Monica: You read comic books right?
Monica: Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
Monica: Yeah
Monica: What?! Really?!

Monica: What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! (Her stomach) As hard asyou can!
Monica: Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that,yknow, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
Monica: Oh my God, Phoebe!
Monica: Youre getting a crush on your sisters fiancée.
Monica: I cant answer that! Chandlers my husband.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Ross is really strong! Okay, hes the strongest out of all three ofyou! (Joey looks at her.) Except for Joey.
Monica: Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! (Breaks it up.) Now listen, noones gonna fight in this apartment.
Monica: (To Chandler) Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay?Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me. Youre loyal,youre honest, and you have integrity! Thats the kind of strength that I wantin the man that I love!
Monica: (To Phoebe) Oh God!
Monica: Chandlers making his sex face.
Monica: Look, I wanted to tell Im-Im sorry you lost.
Monica: (laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.
Monica: Chandler please!
Monica: Lets go big bunny!
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Oh my God! You cleaned! (Gasps) Look at these floors! You did thewindows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And naggingworks!
Monica: Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
Monica: Well then who?
Monica: (shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other womanwas here cleaning then
Monica: Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
Monica: Did she really say that?
Monica: Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.
Monica: Well, usually when Im this anxious, I clean!
Monica: Oh well umm, I make it myself! Its two parts ammonia and one partlemon juice. And now the secret ingredient isyknow what? We just met.
Monica: (To Chandler) I love her.
Monica: Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)
Monica: She stole my jeans!
Monica: I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
Monica: Dont you see? Its the perfect crime!
Monica: I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeansand I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comesback I will find it and show you that stain!
Monica: I guess.
Monica: Fine. Im just glad I didnt give her my secret ingredient.
Monica: Yeah! (Laughs.)
Monica: Nice jeans!
Monica: Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) Youre not gettin it.
Monica: Oh, I fell asleep.
Monica: Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? Thatll really work upyour appetite for lunch.
Monica: Hello.
Monica: Im sorry. Ive never had a maid before, is this not okay?
Monica: Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
Monica: Because I put my head between her legs.
Monica: Theyre my pants!
Monica: No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Monica: Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink brastrap on the way.) Shes wearing my bra!
Monica: My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
Monica: Heres the plan! Okay? Im going to leave you get a look atBrendas bra!
Monica: I would do it but she thinks Im attracted to her!
Monica: Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on were ateam! Were in this together!
Monica: Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at womans breasts allthe time!
Monica: Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a womans breasts.)
Monica: Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, youll know its mine because onthe right cup, the lacey part, theres a very noticeable rip.
Monica: (looking at Rachels jeans) Where did you get those jeans?!
Monica: No I didnt!
Monica: Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
Monica: The pink one with the flowers?!
Monica: Sounds about right.
Monica: (recognizing him and panicking) No you dont!
Monica: Im sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
Monica: Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite mein the ass!
Monica: (entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really badabout the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight youre gonna have a bachelorparty.
Monica: Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper tocome dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
Monica: Come on! Come on, itll be fun! Itll make me feel so muchbetter.
Monica: So dont think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as aatwo month anniversary present.
Monica: Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
Monica: Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
Monica: Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girls number.
Monica: My husband.
Monica: Shes a stripper.
Monica: Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
Monica: Oh my God Stu! I-I cant believe you did this! Now are youabsolutely sure shes a hooker?
Monica: (entering quickly) Shes a hooker! Shes a hooker! Shesa (Stops as she sees her.) Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone. (Goes and shakes thehookers hand.)
Monica: I swear I didnt know she was a hooker! I mean whDid you lether smoke in here?
Monica: Yknow what? Im gonna make this up to you. I promised you astripper (turns on the radio), and youre gonna get a stripper. (She starts tostrip.)
Monica: What?
Monica: Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think Ill take them off.(Goes to do so.)
Monica: Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchenknocking something down, but she continues to strip.)
Monica: (entering) Oh good youre all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, fouroclock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert fromhigh school?
Monica: He was in Rosss classmarching bandkinda overweight?Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
Monica: No that was Jarred! Wow! I havent thought about him in a longtime (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, ummWills, Wills here on business and he didnt have a place to go so Iinvited him here.
Monica: Oh, and by the way, hes lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looksgoo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.) I stilllove Chandler.
Monica: All right okay, just so you know, Im not gonna make a turkey thisyear.
Monica: Well Phoebe doesnt eat turkey
Monica: All right! Okay, its just Phoebe. Wills still on a diet,Chandler doesnt eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachels having her aversion topoultry.
Monica: Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey forjust three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
Monica: All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheresgonna be a ton left over.
Monica: All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in justone sitting?
Monica: Hey, isnt weird to think about how next year at this timetheyll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeinghim) Rachels! But good to know where youre at!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: You too!
Monica: Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but hesreally into the game so I dont want to bother him. Could you help me fold thesenapkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)
Monica: Im gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Monica: No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! Were not at a barndance. Youve gottayou wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you atChristmas time, remember?
Monica: Is your team winning hon?
Monica: Oh, I didnt know you liked football.
Monica: You like Green Bay?
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Aww thanks! God Will Im so glad that you came! You look great! Youmustve lost like
Monica: A pie! (Will brought a pie.)
Monica: You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler.Chandler, this is Will.
Monica: This is Phoebe.
Monica: (to Will) Wanna give me a hand?
Monica: Well you look incredible too! Youre justyoure so fit!
Monica: Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
Monica: Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)
Monica: Is there a problem?
Monica: What?
Monica: Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, youve got almost anentire turkey to eat.
Monica: All right.
Monica: Will! From high school.
Monica: (to Will) Joey.
Monica: Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.)
Monica: Thats Will from high school!
Monica: Okay, dinners ready!
Monica: Oh, so who won?
Monica: What?
Monica: (breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why dont you sit here? (Nextto Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)
Monica: (laughs) This is Chandlers chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets downa huge turkey.)
Monica: About nineteen pounds.
Monica: (To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in highschool.
Monica: Oh Will. But you-youve worked so hard
Monica: Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will whostarts dishing out a large helping.)
Monica: I swear I didnt. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys usedto go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
Monica: Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
Monica: You started that?!
Monica: Everyone at our school heard it!
Monica: I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry andthen show it to me.
Monica: Joey, you dont have to finish that.
Monica: Oh! Me too!
Monica: Thats not totally true.
Monica: Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs.Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
Monica: Its true?!!
Monica: Didnt she walk with a cane?
Monica: All right, listen youre just being silly. Rachel, even with thatrumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you.One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
Monica: And Ross, if it werent for Rachels rumor I mean no one inhigh school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
Monica: Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to bepretty.
Monica: Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-youve beenthrough so much since then. And right now youve got so much more important stuffgoing on in your life. Cant you just let this go?
Monica: Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
Monica: Yeah, you want some?
Monica: Hey! So what do you think?
Monica: Yes! Now, theyre a little more than I normally spend onbootsor rent (Shows him the receipt.)
Monica: I know.
Monica: Im sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswomanwas looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Theyre mine!
Monica: Honey, Im not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost alot, but Im going to wear them all the time. Youll see. Besides, I love thecompliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
Monica: Nice try; Im keeping the boots.
Monica: Hey guys!
Monica: Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.)
Monica: See Chandler? Im getting a lot of use out of them already!Theyre very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, withpants
Monica: (almost crying) They hurt so much!
Monica: The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Monica: I cant! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler thatId wear them all the time, I just cant give them away!
Monica: I cant do that either! The soles are already a littlescuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
Monica: (standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!
Monica: Oh nothing Im justjust was yawning. (Mimics the groan frombefore and stretches.)
Monica: Honey, we dont really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Monica: I-I dont-I dont think that Im gonna wear the bootstonight.
Monica: Well yknow, Im just-Im just worried that bosses willsee them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see themand-and want a raise!
Monica: Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and theboots dont really go with it.
Monica: Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, Ill wear the boots. Infact, Ill go into my room right now and yknow try the outfit on.
Monica: Okay? (She starts to walk which causes her to start crying) Ooo wee!Christmas party in my boots! (Runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ow withlaughing.)
Monica: Yeah! I didnt know there would be dancing. That was a funsurprise!
Monica: Oh no, we cant walk!
Monica: Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climbdown through the manhole cover?
Monica: I cant walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
Monica: Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them!Theyre killing me! One toe at a time!
Monica: How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Monica: Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots offfirst. (She starts taking them off.) AhOohOohhOhhOhGodOhhOhOhhOhhhh
Monica: (notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Monica: My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see theprice?
Monica: Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now.Just-just give me my boots.
Monica: Well I dont have them either. Where are they?
Monica: Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!
Monica: Okay, Im never gonna wear them again. I just didnt get achance to say goodbye.
Monica: Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right.
Monica: (to the boots) Bye bootsWait! Half off?! (Chandler runs off.)
Monica: Yes, hi.
Monica: No leg-chewing for us sir.
Monica: I cant think of anything were doing. (Quietly) Whycant I think of anything were doing?
Monica: Okay, Ill see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know,were not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend anotherevening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Monica: Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behavedat our engagement party.
Monica: Why did you do that?
Monica: Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up youpractically came on to me.
Monica: Hey, I couldve had you if I wanted you.
Monica: You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Monica: Like asking her to move in with you?
Monica: Making her a mixed tape?
Monica: All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I loveyou.
Monica: That is a slap in the face.
Monica: Hi Roger.
Monica: Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think hell havesex with you.
Monica: From the tequila factory?
Monica: Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Monica: I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holidaycard this year?
Monica: (interrupting) I love it! Its huge!! Lets open it! Open it!!(Monica rips open the paper.)
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
Monica: All right. (He goes to push it and it doesnt move.)
Monica: Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade!This is likeOh my, this is like my second favorite game!
Monica: Well I-I really dont remember the name of it.
Monica: Well, you justyou put a quarter in and yknow pull-pull somehandles and win like a candy bar or something.
Monica: Dont feel bad for me! I won like every time!
Monica: Okay, Im next. (Phoebe starts another game.) Dont!Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!
Monica: Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
Monica: You only think its stupid because you suck at it.
Monica: No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why dont yougo home and wait for the thank you card?
Monica: Okay. Phoebe thats it. Come on, get outout of the chair. Getout! (She goes to move Phoebe, but Phoebe goes limp and Monica cant move her.) OhcomePhoebe!
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Well it clearly wasnt showering or shaving.
Monica: Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Manwhile I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
Monica: What is the matter with your hand?
Monica: Chandler, why would you do that?
Monica: You think this is clever?
Monica: Hey wait a minute, this one isnt dirty.
Monica: Ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting oneof those from me. But Bens coming over here tomorrow to play this game, thiscant be there.
Monica: Chandler! Hes seven; hes not stupid.
Monica: All right, look Im just gonna unplug it.
Monica: Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
Monica: All right fine. Fine, Ill do it. Ive just got to get thisoff the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
Monica: Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back overhere. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. Its gotRight(She dies.)Well, youre just a little bitch, arent you?
Monica: Theyre all Chandler.
Monica: But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
Monica: Oh my God Phoebe, youre on fire!
Monica: Dont touch her!!
Monica: (airily) Hi.
Monica: I just had the most amazing bath.
Monica: Wait, you like them with me.
Monica: Oh, baths are so relaxing!
Monica: How dirty do you think I am? Im telling you, if you had some candlesand some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
Monica: Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
Monica: No, but someones really not going to get over that idea, are they?
Monica: I drew you a bath!
Monica: Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff!I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And gotyou this little plastic Navy ship. So its a boy bath!
Monica: I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
Monica: Absolutely.
Monica: Bet I know how that discussions going to go.
Monica: (entering) So?
Monica: I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give youa facial!
Monica: Hello?
Monica: You know what? I-I think Ill wait out here. 
Monica: Oh. (She goes into the bathroom.) Whats wrong?
Monica: What?
Monica: Okay, lets talk about something else.
Monica: Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talkingabout rules and right and wrong and
Monica: You did? What was he talking about?
Monica: (groans) That was a long night.
Monica: Okay, he was talking about rules.
Monica: Umm, and looking at people differently.
Monica: What did he tell you?
Monica: Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wantsto do what you and I did in London with someone.
Monica: Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
Monica: And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
Monica: Just a minute! (To Chandler) Thats Mrs. Tribbiani!
Monica: Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start thegreatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could allstart having babies?
Monica: You just stay here! (Dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)
Monica: Oh, you had that? 
Monica: I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
Monica: Nothing.
Monica: I mean, I-I, I really shouldnt say. I mean, Im really notsupposed to.
Monica: Its a humdinger!
Monica: Somebody likes you!
Monica: No!
Monica: Its Joey!
Monica: Is it something youd be interested in?
Monica: I guess that makes sense. So, you think youre going to talk to him?
Monica: Not Chandler, just Joey.
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Yeah, Im going to take a bath. Im just going to get a magazine.
Monica: What do you think youre doing?
Monica: I know that youre new at this, but this is completely unacceptablebath decorum.
Monica: Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now yourejust a girl in a tub!
Monica: She pulled it out of me! Shes like a conversational wizard!Howd it go?
Monica: What?
Monica: (Pause) I dont think Id care.
Monica: Oh my God! A friend hes looking at differently, but its wrong.Its Rachel!
Monica: Honey, cover it up with the boat!
Monica: It sure is nice to do this together, isnt it?
Monica: Im not touching you.
Monica: Its the salts.
Monica: (To herself) Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!
Monica: (opens the door wearing a robe, but leaves the chain on) Hey,whats up?
Monica: Oh, okay. No problem.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Here you go.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: What?!
Monica: Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
Monica: Yes! Exactly.
Monica: (laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)
Monica: Phoebe, I can explain!
Monica: Well umm, Alexandra has been
Monica: Phoebe, dont get upset!
Monica: Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; theydont like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)
Monica: No, it doesnt say where it came from. Where would we return it?
Monica: Why dont we just find a place for it?
Monica: No! Thats where we keep the canned goods! Have you completelyforgotten everything you learned at orientation?
Monica: Oh, okay. Here, why dont you let me do it?
Monica: No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Monica: Feminine stuff.
Monica: Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love meyou-youll let it go.
Monica: Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)
Monica: Well itsI mean Id justId beself-conscious. Youre my friend; Id be naked.
Monica: Thats different, we were roommates! And when?!
Monica: Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
Monica: Okay, if it means that much to you
Monica: Dinosaurs.
Monica: Yes. 
Monica: Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Monica: No. Ooohh
Monica: (in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah! 
Monica: Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh thats it! Thatsit! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh (Covers bothears and continues the massage with her elbows.)
Monica: Hey.
Monica: I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
Monica: So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
Monica: Okay.
Monica: What?
Monica: Whats going on?
Monica: What? (Laughs.)
Monica: What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises Imake!
Monica: Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna getmassaged again!
Monica: Really?!
Monica: Are you sure?
Monica: I guess.
Monica: (entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!
Monica: Oh no! You werent supposed to see this!
Monica: No Chandler, you dont understand! (Chandler starts singing thetheme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay!Fine! Now you know. Okay? Im yknowIm sick.
Monica: Really? You promise you wont tell anyone?
Monica: Wellits just ummIm afraid you might mess it up.
Monica: Ohhh.
Monica: Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
Monica: Oh God!
Monica: Oh yeah right there!
Monica: Uh Phoebe?
Monica: (entering with something behind her back) Phoebe, cmere. I want toshow you something in the bathroom.
Monica: Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebes opinion on forValentines Day.
Monica: Not really.
Monica: All right, big brother. (holds up two ermrevealing articles ofclothing) Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so yourbest friend would want to do her?
Monica: (from her bedroom) Okay! Ill be right out. Im slipping intosomething a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
Monica: (entering from her bedroom) So what do you think? (referring to her outfit)
Monica: (to herself) Ive still got it!
Monica: What is it?
Monica: Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebes.Why were you even watching it?
Monica: Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for ValentinesDay (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, its about ayoung girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up havingsex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) Oh, wait a minute. Thosearent stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?
Monica: Honey, whats going on?
Monica: Mm-hmm.
Monica: Chandler, we cant let this tape wreck Valentines Day!
Monica: Child-birth, its a natural thing! Its beautiful.
Monica: Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
Monica: Dont touch me!
Monica: How long has it been this time?
Monica: Thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think aboutitexcept all I did was think about it.
Monica: Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why dont we get rid of the tapeand pretend it never existed?
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Oh, thank God!
Monica: Come in!
Monica: Oh, my God.
Monica: Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? Its here.
Monica: No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
Monica: Shes rightof course not. Honey, get the tape.
Monica: Itsstill beautiful.
Monica: I know! I know, Im so sorry for you!
Monica: Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
Monica: OhRach!
Monica: Hey.
Monica: I just talked to Joey, I justI want to see how you were.
Monica: All right, I know youre hurting, and-and I want to be supportive,but dont say that again.
Monica: Honey, I dont think thats something we need to worry about!First of all hes-hes never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even ifhe did you have no idea how shed react.
Monica: Joeyhes not even thinking about going after Rachel!
Monica: No! All hes thinking about is how youre taking this! I mean,listen its totally freaking him out. Hes talking about moving to Vermont.
Monica: He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.
Monica: Honey I cant even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, Idont want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know thatyoure still his friend.
Monica: All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollarsinto Vermont money.
Monica: Hi!
Monica: So, what have you guys been doing?
Monica: I know! What is this, 1985?!
Monica: Not really.
Monica: So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Monica: Oh my God! Thats my restaurant, Im the chef there.
Monica: No!
Monica: Oh, Id like a latte. Oh yknow what? If youre gonnatalk about me, Im gonna go with you. 
Monica: (returning) Phoebe, good work.
Monica: Yeah! Oh hes great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares atPhoebe.)
Monica: Me too! Yeah, Chandler cant stand it. He wont even allow meto have blue cheese in the house.
Monica: You know what Id love to do? I would like to go to France and eatnothing but bread and cheeseNot even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah.Ah, and pastries (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, Im really not high, itsjust I used to be fat.
Monica: Id move in tomorrow!
Monica: Id like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldnt that be nice?
Monica: Are you okay? Youve been acting weird all afternoon.
Monica: Jeez! What is with you?
Monica: All right, whats going on?
Monica: Chandler, you dont believe in soul mates?
Monica: I dont believe in soul mates either.
Monica: No. I dont think that you and I were destined to end up together.I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work reallyhard.
Monica: No, Ive had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hardthat would be to clean?
Monica: I know.
Monica: Joey, you have to talk to her!
Monica: Hey Rachel!
Monica: I dont see him. Hey! Maybe hes in the sugar bowl! (Opens thesugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)
Monica: Whats up?
Monica: We were playing a game.
Monica: Sure.
Monica: (To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?
Monica: Honey, you gotta talk to her.
Monica: Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are meanwhen theyre hungry.
Monica: This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk toher again? I mean I know its weird, its awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Monica: Okay, Im done. Read mine.
Monica: (stunned) I-Im the head chef. I-I cant get promoted.
Monica: You mean your pink shirt?
Monica: No, I-I havent seen your pink shirt.
Monica: Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
Monica: Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
Monica: Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
Monica: Where is the James Taylor CD?
Monica: Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, werejust gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
Monica: Hmm, I dont know. We really have to talk this through.
Monica: Okay, I-Im sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on thisuncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see himtry to get him talking about something else.
Monica: Yeah, like I dont know, maybe you have a work problem that youneed his advice on.
Monica: Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
Monica: Uh I really dont know what to tell you Rach, I really dont.I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
Monica: Yeah Joey shesRachels got this really big workproblem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Yknow what, if weregonna make dinner were gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)
Monica: Honey, both yours.
Monica: Yeah? The work problem?
Chandler and Monica: What?!
Monica: You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
Monica: Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Monica: Thats not your regular dry cleaners.
Monica: What?!
Monica: Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet agreat guy, so can you.
Monica: Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneylandfor me. Im-Im gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (Shepoints to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)
Monica: (to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: (To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to momand dad this year?
Monica: Yeah, Id really like to.
Monica: Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and its always reallymoving, and always makes them cry. Well this year Im going to make them cry.
Monica: No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him,and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, yourbrother." Know what theyll say this year? "God, you"
Monica: Really you can do that?
Monica: Oh Im working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it.Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)
Monica: Its a dead dog. Thats Chi-Chi; she died when I was in highschool.
Monica: The good stuff, huh?
Monica: You got a present for my parents. Thats so sweet.
Monica: What?!
Monica: Thats my old dog. He passed away years ago.
Monica: Its out on the island. Its in Massapequa. 
Monica: Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents? 
Monica: And Ive got the car keys.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
Monica: Its just that, its so much.
Monica: I feel terrible.
Monica: Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit em. Icant wait. Theyre going to be crying so hard. Theyre going to befighting for breath. 
Monica: Okay its time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usuallygives the toast, but this year Im going to do it.
Monica: No, no its going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I gotmarried, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the twoof you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know Iprobably dont say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parentswill join her.) When I look around this room, Im-Im saddened by the thought ofthose who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to behere, but she cant because shes dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look howcute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by thestage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember shes dead. Okay, her andNana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to herchildren in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didnt see that?No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutesthese orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waitsfor people to cry, but doesnt get any tears.) You people are made of stone!Heres to mom and dad! Whatever!
Monica: Okay thats it. I give up. At mom and dads 40thanniversary, youre the one giving the speech. 
Monica: Oh, come on. 
Monica: (starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it? 
Monica: Hey!
Monica: How cool is this?! We know three down! Im touching three down!(She has her hand on his shoulder.)
Monica: Three down knows Im married, whats three down doin?
Monica: (To Chandler) You think were being obvious?
Monica: Joey! Youre doing great!
Monica: Bye. (They resume their previous positions.)
Monica: You cant say that!! You-you dont know!! I mean I thoughtI was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldnt...bend thatway. So... (Looks at Joey.)
Monica: You slept with her didnt you?
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
Monica: Oh my God, your mother!
Monica: Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully bigcoincidence if she was.
Monica: Well it wasnt my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
Monica: (interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!
Monica: Okay, yknow what? Dont worry, okay? Well take care ofit. Well call her. Just go home and get ready.
Monica: Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs.Green.) (To Phoebe) Wait a minute! If youre in charge of the invitations why am Ithe one who has to call herHello Mrs. Green! Hi, its Monica Geller.
Monica: (on phone) Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but weve decided tothrow an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
Monica: Yeah, Im sorry. Im-Im so sorry.
Monica: (To Phoebe) Oh my God, my ass is sweating! (on phone) Please! Please!Can you come? Its today at four.
Monica: Thank you. (Hangs up.)
Monica: Son of a bitch! (Calls Mrs. Green again.)
Monica: You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Monica: Hi!
Monica: Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could notfeel worse about it.
Monica: Shes still mad.
Monica: Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?
Monica: Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass.
Monica: What?
Monica: I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
Monica: Thats right. That is right, you go over there and tell her youdont want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
Monica: (To Phoebe) This is great! Now shes gonna be mad at Rachel!Yknow what? And Im just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter shenever had.
Monica: Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opensshould be from the grandmother of the baby, because youre the most important personin this room. And in the world!
Monica: Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
Monica: It is going to be okay! (Mrs. Green glances over her shoulder andglares at Monica while she heads for the bathroom.) It was worth a shot.
Monica: Its frightening.
Monica: (laughs) Youre still so funny. Youre so funny. (To Phoebe)What do I do?
Monica: Yknow what? Youre-youre right.
Monica: Really?
Monica: Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monicafollows her out into the hall with Phoebe in tow.) It is rude to leave a party withoutsaying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decentthing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasnt on purpose! But whatyoure during to me now is just plain spiteful!
Monica: Thats right! Maybe its time you took a good hard look at amirror young ladyold ladylady!
Monica: So whenever youre ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you.Good day! (Monica and Phoebe reenter the apartment and Monica closes the door on a stunnedMrs. Green.) I cant feel my legs!
Monica: Yeah? Im proud of me too.
Monica: Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
Monica: Okay. (When Phoebe turns around Monica runs out into the hall after Mrs.Green.) Mrs. Green! Okay Im really sorry!! Im apologizing for the(Shetrips and falls down the stairs.) (Pause) Okay, I bit my tongue, but Im stillreally sorry!
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Monica: (seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers!It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Monica: (reading) Oh dear God!
Monica: What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Monica: Oh my God, this is horrible!
Monica: Im so humiliated!
Monica: You dont think that umm, (reading) "The chefs Mahi Mahiwas awful awful," is bad press?
Monica: Is he right? Am I reallyAm I awful?
Monica: We said at the movies, but
Monica: Joey! (He returns) Now that youre here
Monica: Hey Joey, come taste this.
Monica: Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well (Feeds him aspoonful of what shes cooking.) Im getting my revenge!
Monica: No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so beforewe go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, Icannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits:I was wrong about Monica."
Monica: Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.
Monica: I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I wouldlike for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
Monica: Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?
Monica: I can.
Monica: Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise hasshallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon. 
Monica: Monica.
Monica: Okay. (Does so.)
Monica: Oh no! I dont know anything about cooking. I had to ask someonewhat its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
Monica: I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear whatyou said. Umm, hats off to who now?
Monica: Thats right.
Monica: Yknow, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty offashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give methe star. (Hands it to her.)
Monica: Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-andIm sorry, but I dont care.
Monica: Joey! Im so proud of you!
Monica: Excuse me? He doesnt even know what hes doing!
Monica: I do! Im a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax!Its not a courtroom drama!
Monica: Im-Im sorry, its just that umm Well I-I cook atthis restaurant, Alessandros, and umm I just got a really bad review
Monica: You do?
Monica: Oh, Im totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
Monica: Okay then, I dont stink. Im a good chef. Okay. (Starts toleave.)
Monica: Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Are we gonna take a limo?
Monica: Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Monica: What are you doing here so early?
Monica: Well, well Ross didnt care enough to be here, so I think hesout. You snooze you lose.
Monica: Well then somebodys snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affectyou at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cutdown to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)
Monica: Star in a movie.
Monica: Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots youregonna take him? Joey, I dont think youre comprehending just how slutty thisdress is!
Monica: Shes over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?
Monica: Hmm, care to make it interesting? Ill bet you that shellhave it by this time tomorrow.
Monica: Okay, how much?
Monica: How about fifty bucks?
Monica: Damnit! Damnit!! Heres your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)
Monica: Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Shes in the bathroom.
Monica: Im actually with her on this one.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
Monica: Well what is it? What is it? If its gonna help bring the babyhere, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
Monica: Do it!
Monica: Im just saying its been a really long time for you. I mean,women have needs. Do it, get yours!
Monica: All right, lets be practical, if Ross isnt willing to do it,hes not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrowChandlerChandler is good!
Monica: Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
Monica: Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that youre gonna have the babyand I dont want to lose again!
Monica: Wait a minute! Now Im betting against all three of you?
Monica: Oh, okay!
Monica: Two hundred.
Monica: Thats it. Im done. I dont care when the baby comes, nomore betting.
Monica: Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) Iguess we can bet one more time.
Monica: How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joeys apartment.) Joey!Chandler!! Its time!
Monica: You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby isover seven pounds. (Phoebe isnt interested.) I bet you it has hair. (Shesstill not interested.) I bet you its a girl.
Monica: (following her) Ill give you really good odds.
Monica: How are you doing?
Monica: We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
Monica: Hey, you wanna see something?
Monica: Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
Monica: Listen uh, I-Ive been doing some thinking, and I dont knowwhether its because were here or Rachels giving birth but umm, I thinkwe should try to have a baby.
Monica: (freaking out) What-what-whats that now?!
Monica: What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think were ready to have ababy now?!
Monica: Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all highand weird like mine is now!
Monica: Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) Cause I am readyto have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
Monica: Thats it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
Monica: Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it! 
Monica: What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
Monica: What?
Monica: We are pretty good.
Monica: Well maybe Im ready now. I mean, its a little scary, butmaybe its right.
Monica: What?!!
Monica: So were gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
Monica: Okay, hold on a sec.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Well, we could start trying. Now.
Monica: No, not here. Maybe here.
Monica: And its so clean!!
Monica: I think we found a place.
Monica: Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
Monica: Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
Monica: Okay. Lets hurryOh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks ather.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)
Monica: We could, or we can have sex in it.
Monica: (lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!
Monica: Does that sound like Janice?
Monica: Hey!
Monica: I cant believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Monica: Oh my God! Shes amazing. Oh, oh Im so glad you guys gotdrunk and had sex!
Monica: Whats the matter?
Monica: Its okay honey, youll find a name.
Monica: Yeah, Ive had them picked out since I was fourteen.
Monica: Umm, okay. If its a boy its Daniel.
Monica: I dont want to say.
Monica: Okay. Its Emma.
Monica: Take it.
Monica: Its clearly an Emma.
Monica: Yeah, but I love you more. Besides yknow, nothing goes with Bing.So Im screwed. I mean (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah,thats you. Youre our little Em. Oh whats that honey? What? Oh, you wanta little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!
Monica: I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our ownbaby.
Monica: (entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey lookwhos here!
Monica: Oh, Aunt Liddys coming? That means we get five dollars each!
Monica: About what?
Monica: Isnt she beautiful?
Monica: I want a baby.
Monica: Come on! Come on, if we have sex again itll double our chances ofgetting pregnant. Do you think that closets still available?
Monica: Deal!
Monica: Oh, I still cant believe my dad saw us having sex! He didntmake it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
Monica: Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
Monica: It wasnt fun?!
Monica: The truth is, Dad, were-were trying.
Monica: Yeah, were trying to get pregnant.
Monica: Well, thats okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
Monica: Daddy?!
Monica: Daddy! I dont think we need to hear about the specific positionsyou and mom had sex.
Monica: I dont feel good right now.
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Well, nows a good time. Im on my way to have my ears cutoff.
Monica: What?
Monica: Is he crazy?! You just had Rosss baby!
Monica: What?! Are you crazy? You just had Rosss baby! Its-itsso inappropriate. No, its worse than that. Its wrong. Its It isbigger than mine! (Rachels engagement ring.)
Monica: You cant marry him!
Monica: Well do you love him?
Monica: Sure?
Monica: Honey, the question isdo you really want to marry Joey?
Monica: (walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!
Monica: Ok, I dont wanna be negative so Ill say that most of thesigns you bought are good.
Monica: (looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy.(Waking him up.) Honey.
Monica: Honey why dont you go lie down.
Monica: Phoebe did the signs!
Monica: Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pitapocket.
Monica: Wow, hes really not letting this go, is he?
Monica: Breaks your heart doesnt it
Monica: Alright heres something, it says to try holding the baby close toyour body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Monica: It worked!
Monica: Umm, she Rach, not it, she. 
Monica: Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
Monica: Try feeding her again.
Monica: I know, thats why I said again!
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Okay whats up
Monica: Oh yeah (smiles).
Monica: What? Who says that?
Monica: Whats going on?
Monica: Excuse me?
Monica: (stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!
Monica: Chandler, I dont even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
Monica: Are you trying to tell me that were moving to Oklahoma, or thatyoure gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a hugeraise?
Monica: Thank you.
Monica: Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
Monica: About a week and a half.
Monica: Rach, try holding her a different way.
Monica: Youre just new at this, itll get better, think about yourfirst day at work. I mean, that couldnt have been easy but you figured that out.
Monica: Okay Ill take her, here. (Takes Emma)
Monica: (To Emma) Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Oohbaby baby. (Emma stops crying and falls asleep)
Monica: It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
Monica: I cant believe it!  Shes asleep!  I got her to goto sleep!   I have actual magical powers!
Monica: Yes I did, Im Monica, Super Aunt
Monica: Yes I am!!
Monica: Say what?
Monica: (stands up to hand Emma back) Oh no no no no!
Monica: What?
Monica: Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
Monica: No.
Monica: (loudly) What!?
Monica: (comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) Got it! Got it! Got it!Got it! Got it! Got it!
Monica: I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid  thing (Points to her wedding ring.)
Monica: Hey!
Monica: You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Monica: It's great! How?
Monica: So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks  about it.) No.
Monica: No. I can't be away from you for that long.
Monica: Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a  different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Monica: Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but  if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
Monica: I know! (They high-five.) 
Monica: Excuse me?
Monica: Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman? 
Monica: He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said  he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
Monica: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood  therapist.
Monica: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just  really freaked him out.
Monica: That I was going to eat him.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: What are you doing?
Monica: That's so sweet. Find anything?
Monica: Nothing, huh?
Monica: 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
Monica: Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy,  who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
Monica: (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm  good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been  relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?)  is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this  is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo  (sp?) 'I'll take it!'
Monica: You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.
Monica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,  Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
Monica: Manhattan.
Monica: I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot  to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Monica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days  is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see  you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really  if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make  it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
Monica: Really?
Monica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Monica: How was the pediatrician?
Monica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Monica: Where have you been?
Monica: Promise to call me when you land.
Monica: I love you too. (They kiss)
Monica: (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes:  Old job, (Raises her hand) new job, (Raises her hand really high) you. This  is just something I have to do.
Monica: I love you so much.
Monica: Can I talk now?
Monica: Joey?
Monica:: hey Joey
Monica:: Joey I am not going to objectify woman with you  (looks at the woman) but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.
Monica:: yeah he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend
Monica:: he has to work, there's some rush on the big (pause,  thinks) ah damn it one of these days I'm really gonna have to start listening  when he talks about his job.
Monica:: maybe I will go (thinks) yea will have a second  honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.
Monica:: how do you know I have one of those?
Chandler: DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica: (smiles)
Monica:: is everything all right?
Monica:: I'm gonna go freshen up ok
Monica:: Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room  and I caught him molesting himself.
Monica:: yea well the weird part is... he was getting off  to a shark attack show!
Monica:: Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
Monica:: do you know how many times I've seen him jump up  like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
Monica:: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone.  not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
Monica:: Eww are you talking about my bother.
Monica:: But you don't remember sleeping with her.
Monica:: what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe  you were having an off night
Monica:: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her  out again.
Monica:: Joey, Joey.
Monica:: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
Monica:: Hi, how was your flight? (She hugs him)
Monica:: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable  because I. (Monica shows him the tape then puts it in) have  a little surprise for you.
Monica:: Ok (sits down next to him) This is how much I love  you. (She presses play then puts her arm around Chandler's neck.)
Monica:: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast  forward to something a little toothier.
Monica:: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video  store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always  have to be sharks?
Monica:: Honey look we can do something else, do you want  me to get into the tub and thrash.
Monica:: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a  part of this.
Monica:: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks  turn you on!
Monica:: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF  a treat.
Monica:: really?
Monica:: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me! (They  hug)
Monica:: Im very, very drunk right now.
Monica: What are you talking about? Were all together right now.
Monica: Oh, dear god!
Monica: (opening the door) Hey!
Monica: Hmhmm. (ties up)
Monica: This is not, what Im wearing. Im ovulating and Chandlers gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
Monica: Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. Well probably be the first ones there.
Monica: (naughty in doorway) Welcome home. Ive missed you. join me in the bedroom?
Monica: (comes over) O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
Monica: You dont need a shower.
Monica: What do I smell? (sniffs him) I smell smoke. Huhdid you smoke?
Monica: (gets a pack out of his jacket)
Monica: How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, its chilling.
Monica: So what? Dont you have any will power?
Monica: You said that was sexy!
Monica: Thats right, because I forbid you to smoke again.
Monica: Mhmm.
Monica: Dont joke (?) with me, okay? Im very, very upset right now.
Monica: Yes.
Monica: Well, Ill tell you what were gonna do: We are already late for Phoebes birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, were gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.
Monica: Sex! This is the last day Im ovulating, and when we dont do it now, well have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)
Monica: Oh yeah!
Monica: Huh, and no cuddling.
Monica: Oh good, I hate it when you do that
Monica: Spend more time with the tie. Thatll make a baby.
Monica: Oh sure, now youre Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncles funeral
Monica: No, youre right. Mnya, we shouldnt do it like this. Huch. For what its worth, Im, Im sorry. I shouldnt have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
Monica: Yah.
Monica: Dyou want to?
Monica: kay.
Monica: You know what? Lets not talk.
Monica: Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
Monica: Oh, blablablabaybaybay.
Monica: I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldnt have sex with me while were fighting.
Monica: Thats right, I got mine.
Monica: (entering with husband) Happy birthday!
Monica: Well, we had a little fight.
Monica: You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down) Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isnt it? How dyou get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
Monica: Why would you do that?
Monica: Moms here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
Monica: Uch, you see, Im ovulating.
Monica: Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just cant get enough.
Monica: Bye.
Monica: So, Im, Im probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
Monica: We dont have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct 
Monica:  (Monica looks at Rachel in disbelief) She said WHAT?
Monica: Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
Monica: No, I think we should save our china for something  really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
Monica: What if something gets broken, they're so expensive. 
Monica: Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen  comes over..
Monica: &lt;laughs&gt; Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you  talk to the queen. 
Monica: Careful. &lt;hands Chandler a china plate&gt; Careful.  CAREFUL! 
Monica: I know, after you left the store, I chose different  ones.
Monica: well no offense honey, but your taste is a little  feminine for me.
Ross to Monica: Hi.
Monica: yeah oh my god, I'm so moved. 
Monica: Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using  our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
Monica: Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will  not be well recieved. &lt;pinches Ross' arm&gt;
Monica: No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See  its a game, whoever gets that plate wins. 
Monica: That was me. 
Monica: Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets  face it you have fun. 
Monica: Thats not how you see me, is it? 
Monica: Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner. 
Monica: Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.  I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of  Merlot and a five year old condom. 
Monica: No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Monica: I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because  I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard  parts. 
Monica: Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
Monica: How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. 
Monica: Oh wait.. What are you doing? 
Monica: Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses  on my wedding dress. 
Monica: Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the  boxes! 
Monica: uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a  plate. Its not like somebody died. 
Monica: I don't care. &lt;pauses and realizes...&gt; Oh my  god. I've lost the will to scold. 
Monica: Like only if the queen comes?
Monica: Bye plates!
Monica: What? Something happened with the plates?
Monica: I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Monica: It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
Monica: It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
Monica: (shocked) You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Monica: No!
Monica: Come on Ben.
Monica: Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
Monica: (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
Monica: Yeah, is that okay?
Monica: No.
Monica: Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Monica: So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Monica: Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
Monica: Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
Monica: Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
Monica: What does she do there?
Monica: She did WHAT?
Monica: *What*??
Monica: Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Okay!
Monica: Merry Christmas.
Monica: Really?
Monica: Well, not anymore.
Monica: I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Monica: Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Monica: Okay!
Monica: (breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?
Monica: This doesn't feel weird!
Monica: You're a really good kisser.
Monica: Hm-hmm!
Monica: Wow! You are really fast!
Monica: We're gonna see each other naked.
Monica: Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Monica: One!
Monica: Two!
Monica: Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Monica: Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
Monica: I think you're better than you think you are.
Monica: (interrupting) Know when to stop.
Monica: Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around:) Don't do the dance.
Monica: I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Monica: You're so efficient. I love you!
Monica: No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
Monica: That'll work!
Monica: Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Monica: That's stealing!
Monica: Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
Monica: Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Monica: Eh, you work for that.
Monica: You do?!
Monica: Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Monica: You thought about that?
Monica: How many kids were we gonna have?
Monica: What else did you think about?
Monica: (laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Monica: No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
Monica: Uh-hmm.
Monica: I love you. (They kiss.)
Monica: "Wendy" is a fat girl name.
Monica: Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
Monica: What are you doing here?
Monica: But I thought if you left, you get fired.
Monica: What?
Monica: Oh my god!
Monica: No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
Chandler: Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica:) Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
Monica: You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
Monica: Would you stop staring at her?
Monica: What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind   of way.
Monica: Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl   for once.
Monica: They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
Monica: (to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)
Monica: Hey Rach!
Monica: Ready for your birthday lunch?
Monica: Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Monica: You were just being so nice to him!
Monica: Right there! That was so fake!
Monica: Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
Monica: Does he?
Monica: Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first   grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly   had a crush on me?
Monica: Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)
Monica: Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
Monica: So this is what a stroke feels like.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
Monica: Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from   your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).
Monica: Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
Monica: (from inside) Again, you're welcome.
Monica: Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)
Monica: No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...
Monica: Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
Monica: It's just, I'm not good at singing.
Monica: No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Monica: So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
Monica: I'm there!
Monica: You kissed him?
Monica: Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
Monica: Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
Monica: I thought you hated him?
Monica: So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
Monica: Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross
Monica: No I told you I can't.
Monica: What have you heard me sing?
Monica: What?
Monica: Yeah I do rock that one.
Monica: Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
Monica: "Delta Dawn"
Monica: Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
Monica: Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."
Monica: "To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
Monica: "Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
Monica: I can’t believe I did this. I can’t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting “look at those tips”! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
Monica: Good? Didn’t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That’s is the best gift ever.
Monica: Ok, for my next song I think I’ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters “I am so excited”. And make it bouncy!
Monica: Honey, you’re just in time, I’m about to sing another song!
Monica: And they love me!
Monica: All right, watch!
Monica: "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..."
Monica: Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
Monica: Oh my god.
Monica: Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
Monica: You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
Monica: Oh, it's perfect.
Monica: Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until      the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: No, it's not.
Monica: Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have      also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
Monica: Chandler!
Monica: We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
Monica: So, let's do this.
Monica: Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
Monica: Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're      right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
Monica: Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware      of at this age?
Monica: Canoodling?
Monica: I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't      so...
Monica: I guess you're right.
Monica: But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
Monica: She's asleep. Chandler?
Monica: What are you doing?
Monica: She's asleep.
Monica: Yes, but we have to be fast.
Monica: Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
Monica: Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
Monica: Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
Monica: Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.      You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
Monica: Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,      we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
Monica: Hey, did you stop by here?
Monica: Oh my god, then...
Monica: Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
Monica: Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just – she loves      it when I'm dramatic.
Monica: No, we weren't!
Monica: No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
Monica: Unless what?
Monica: I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since  I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all  our money?
Monica: I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than  we're bringing in.
Monica: Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask  you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know...  finding gold.
Monica: Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Monica: Why not?
Monica: Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
Monica: Hey Joey!
Monica: Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never  get back to Chandler.
Monica: (Looks exasperated) Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's  not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
Monica: But Chandler lent you money!
Monica: Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
Monica: Two thousand dollars?
Monica: Yeah...
Joey &amp; Monica: Hey!
Monica: Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
Monica: You're a pig. And you can't do this.
Monica: Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal  your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look  like" (Looks at Chandler)
Monica: Is that a bit you guys do?
Monica: We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Monica: I hear wedding bells.
Monica: Don't you mean..groomy?
Monica: I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
Monica: So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Monica: Thank you?
Monica: Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Monica: Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still  ok.
Monica: Okay...
Monica: I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
Monica: Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting  to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Monica: You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just  don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling  coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
Monica: Honey?
Monica: About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Monica: I'm going to get bigger!
Monica: Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not!  And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger  too.
Monica: It's kind of a package deal!
Monica: I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Monica: Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
Chandler/Joey/Rachel/Monica: Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Monica: We're all sorry... (They have a group hug)
Monica: Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Monica: Ok, you got it!
Monica: Really? If that's what you want... 
Monica: Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Monica: Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  (reads from the screen) "gay as the day is long"?
Monica: But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)
Monica: (On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Monica: What are you doing?
Monica: Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
Monica: What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Monica: Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.
Monica: And now your cell.
Monica: This is your cellphone?
Monica: This is your current cellphone?
Monica: Phoebe, where's your purse?
Monica: No, no! Give it to me!
Monica: Give it to me!
Monica: I'll go in there.
Monica: Phoebe come here
Monica: Haha!
Monica: Haha!
Monica: So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
Monica: Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
Monica: Who's that? (goes to open door)
Monica: (To Mike) What are you doing here?
Monica: Phoebe!
Monica: Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Monica: Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
Monica: (to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!
Monica: Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
Monica: Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).
Monica: Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)
Monica: I've been pretty good!
Monica: Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Monica: You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
Monica: Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
Monica: (running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!
Monica: Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
Monica: Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
Monica: Excuse me?
Monica: Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
Monica: You didn't hear the speech!
Monica: Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
Monica: You're... weird!
Monica: Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!
Monica: Damn it!
Monica: And I blame you too.
Monica: Hi, glad you could come.
Monica: So, did you know Ross well?
Monica: (a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me.
Monica: I look like a man??
Monica: You are married though.
Monica: Ok.
Monica: But ehm...what is it not?
Monica: And what else is it not?
Monica: Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need itfor anyway?
Monica: Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buysome tickets myself! 
Monica: Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could reallyuse 300 million dollars.
Monica: How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Monica: God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! Youknow I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
Monica: Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only wayI could win something? 
Monica: (smiling)That was a good day!
Monica: I'm parked in a garage on Morton! 
Monica: (to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the bigbucks?
Monica: Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting anassistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they areonly hiring three.
Monica: Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up yourpants!
Monica: Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extraluck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
Monica: Alright, who wants to do it?
Monica: Ok, hey Rach?
Monica: Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishingfor the same thing, right?
Monica: Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!
Monica: I understand, but you're wishing for what we thinkyou're wishing for, aren't you?
Rachel, Chandler and Monica: Please, just do it!
Monica: You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks foryou.
Monica: Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki"but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you'remy brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
Monica: Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance asanybody else of getting that job!
Monica: Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)
Monica: Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets asquickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideashow to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this: wedivide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read bywhoever finishes their pile first.
Monica: I'm sorry, idea time is over.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: There are no tickets on the nightstand!
Monica: Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
Monica: Chandler, sense the tone!!
Monica: Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me andChandler.
Monica: Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
Monica: When you were reading the dirty magazines withouttaking off the plastic!
Monica: Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are notgonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week andI couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
Monica: Ahhh!  (shocked)
Monica: There's the man I married!!
Monica: Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends!Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look justlike you!
Monica: No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl)and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
Everyone but Monica: Friends! 
Monica: Money! (they all look at her) Friends...
Monica: They're all in there! Even these five that I hid inmy bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)...
Monica: Phoebe, we lost half of them.
Monica: Oh, play them!
Monica: Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
Monica: (she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strongabout this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
Monica: (she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants)131! (they kiss)
Monica: We are on a roll, people!!
Monica: Check your numbers! Make me rich!
Monica: Make me rich!!
Monica: Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!
Monica: (answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Monica: Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
Monica: You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofaand goes to the kitchen area)
Monica: Let me see!
Monica: You know what? You can have mine.
Monica: Hey!
Monica: So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
Monica: Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
Monica: Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
Monica: Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
Monica: Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
Monica: Why don't you take Ross?
Monica: No, not if their room has two beds!
Monica: Thank you!
Monica: Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything...
Monica: Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
Monica: What musician?
Monica: What are you doing here!
Monica: Great!
Monica: Listen Phoebe...
Monica: You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
Monica: This is kind of a classy place.
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Monica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
Monica: What do you think brought than on?
Monica: A love scene? With who?
Monica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.
Monica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Monica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college. 
Monica: It was hard!
Rachel and Monica: Hi.
Monica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
Monica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
Monica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
Monica: Tiny portions?
Monica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
Monica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
Monica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
Monica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
Monica: Ok, you have to stop playing now.
Monica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
Monica: (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)
Monica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).
Monica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)
Monica: Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)
Monica: I'm sorry...
Monica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner? 
Monica: (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!
Monica: It sounds interesting!
Monica: Yeah.
Monica: No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
Monica: No, no, Rachel?
Monica: Who do you wanna fool around with?
Monica: (whispering) You can't!
Monica: In the hall.
Monica: You wanna fool around with Joey?
Monica: Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Monica: Who, who are they?
Monica: Both of them?
Monica: Which one?
Monica: Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
Monica: What the hell are you cooking!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: What's so bad about that?
Monica: (fingering her elbow): Ross?
Monica: (to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?
Monica: (to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Monica: (to Ross) So, did you two have fun?
Monica: And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI!
Monica: Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
Monica: You're not sick!
Monica: Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??
Monica: You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Monica: Ok, what is this?
Monica: (aloud) WHAT?
Monica: Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Monica: The game's over! Take off your robe!
Monica: Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Monica: (Yells after him) I love you!
Monica: Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Monica: (Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
Monica: (Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!
Monica: (to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".
Monica: Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Monica: (yelling after him) We will!!
Monica: (to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!
Monica: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
Monica: Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)
Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).
Monica: Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
Monica: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
Monica: You really liked it?
Monica: Oh really!
Monica: No!
Monica: So I got it when I was 13...
Monica: Hey!
Monica: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Monica: That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Monica: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Monica: Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Monica: And I can't stop you.
Monica: Oh, you're so wonderful.
Monica: It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?   I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
Monica: Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Hey, what's this?
Monica: Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage   chains.
Monica: Do you wanna go hunting?
Monica: And she wants to go hunting, too!!
Monica: (entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!
Monica: Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?
Monica: Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience!   Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need   to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Monica: Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think   it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
Monica: What is the big deal?
Monica: It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do   it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
Monica: Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think   it's a good idea!
Monica: (really embarrassed) OH!
Monica: Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody   is gonna wanna watch that.
Monica: Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going   to be ok?
Monica: I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even   knows you!
Monica: Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
Monica: This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!   (leaves)
Monica: So, what's your name?
Monica: Hey sweetie.
Monica: With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course   it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called".   If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just   called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem   with me or with you?
Monica: What?
Monica: Oh... what does that mean?
Monica: Chandler?
Monica: (weeping) Oh my God!
Monica: I'm sorry too.
Monica: (still weeping) I know.
Monica: Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Monica: Hi.
Monica: Ok.
Monica: Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
Monica: (long pause) Ok.
Monica: Hi honey!
Monica: Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
Monica: I got it.
Monica: Yeah, I guess.
Monica: (turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?
Monica: Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
Monica: Chandler!
Monica: I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
Monica: Uh!
Monica: Tell me about yourself, Zack!
Monica: Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
Monica: Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
Monica: I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
Monica: Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
Monica: Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
Monica: We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound)
Monica: Yess!! (M &amp; C high-five and Zack looks confused again)
Monica: Does seem pretty perfect.
Monica: (pause) No.
Monica: No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
Monica: No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Monica: Yeah, I'm sure.
Monica: That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss)
Monica: Adoption.
Monica: I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
Monica: So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
Monica: (excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
Monica: And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived.
Monica: David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
Monica: (to Chandler) See?
Monica: Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Monica: (pinching her) Let's get you out of here!! (they go outside)
Monica: At least you took me down with you!
Monica: I guess, in time.
Monica: I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Monica: Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Monica: Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
Monica: What? (looks very shocked) Why?
Monica: Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
Monica: They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
Monica: Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
Monica: (to Chandler) Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
Monica: (shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe).
Monica: Yeah, right!
Monica: Ok!
Monica: See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Monica: Ok fine. I'll handle this. (goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel) Phoebe?
Monica: (looking very serious) I need to talk to you.
Monica: What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Monica: Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Monica: Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
Monica: This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
Monica: I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)
Monica: You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? (Mike hangs up the phone) Damnit!
Monica: (sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!
Monica: Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
Monica: No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
Monica: No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
Monica: Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
Monica: I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Monica: Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Monica: IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Monica: You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring...
Monica: (to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
Monica: I know (she snuggles to him)
Monica: The sun is out!
Monica: Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Monica: Damn it!
Monica: Yeah!
Monica: (her hair bigger then before) I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
Monica: So, what are we gonna do today?
Monica: (pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler) Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
Monica: (disappointed) Why not?
Monica: I'm not always that bad!
Monica: (hesitatingly) I punched you...?
Monica: ... Phoebe...?
Monica: I clunked your heads together!
Monica: C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
Monica: But then how do we know who wins?
Monica: So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
Monica: (smiling) OK!
Monica: Sure! Got to!
Monica: Aww!
Monica: Hell, yeah!
Monica: How much were you thinking?
Monica: Make it fifty!
Monica: (nearly shouting) One thousand...
Monica: (going through her pockets) No... (to Chandler and Phoebe) Either of you girls got a quarter?
Monica: Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
Monica: (angry) Ow, what are the chances!
Monica: Ha! My point!
Monica: Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
Monica: Ah, yeah!
Monica: Ah, yeaaah!
Monica: AH YEAAAAH!
Monica: Oh, damn it!
Monica: (threatening) Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
Monica: NO, NO, NOOO!
Monica: Best out of three?
Monica: (to Mike) Serve the ball, chump!
Monica: No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Monica: I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
Monica: Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
Monica: That's just good sense!
Monica: (in pain) Aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)
Monica: No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! (pause) Oh my God! I can't play!
Monica: I can't believe it! (pause) I lost!
Monica: What?
Monica: (to Chandler) Honey, you don't have to do this.
Monica: But... you suck!
Monica: Oh my God! You're good!
Monica: (to Chandler) Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you (pause) Hold on! I almost forgot (she turns to Mike) loser! (back to Chandler) When did you stop sucking?
Monica: Why?
Monica: This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Monica: (to Chandler) Hey sweetie! (they  kiss)
Monica: Chandler gets pedicures!
Monica: There. Here's their card.
Monica: Hey Phoebe!
Monica: I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me  too! She's the worst!
Monica: She's this girl who used to live  in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up  this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda  using an awful British accent) "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
Monica: (pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets  pedicures!
Monica: I know, and she's always bragging  about all the famous people she's met.
Monica: Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't  wanna see her!!
Monica: What?
Monica: Oh, I guess we could try that, but...  it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?
Monica: It could be Amanda!
Monica: You're from Yonkers! Your last name  is Buffo-Martisis!
Monica: We weren’t picking up, it’s  Amanda!
Monica: Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s...  is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe  and I will see you then!
Monica: Well, I said 'no' to her coming  over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to  please people!
Monica: And you would?
Monica: How could you mess this up? It's  so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Monica: One Two Three...
Monica: Wow, really? One time he just looked  at my bra and it popped open.
Monica: Well, you guys have been friends  forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?  You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
Monica: (sees what he is doing) Chandler,  stop! It is not going to pop open!
Monica: Hey Phoebe!
Monica: Is Amanda here yet?
Monica: (sits down) Oh good. Good, look  I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.  Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Monica: Well, what do you think of Mike  and Chandler being in a car accident?
Monica: Hi!
Monica: (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is  Chandler and...
Monica: When were we not friends?
Monica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
Monica: (To Phoebe) You were going to cut  me out?
Monica: Oh My God!
Monica: (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler,  what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more)  Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry,  but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)
Monica: Nope! (She turns and leaves)
Monica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
Monica: I have nothing to say to  you.
Monica: I can't believe you tried to cut  me out. Why Phoebe, why?
Monica: I'm still all those things!
Monica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy.
Monica: It's because I'm scrappy.
Monica: I won't know what I would do without  you.
Monica: Well, I guess we should go back  in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Monica: (she enters) Hey guys!
Monica: That place in Vermont? You can  take  a hint!
Monica: Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
Monica: Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away.   You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
Monica: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Monica: Believe me, that is not why we won't   be doing that!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and   get the fun time started!
Monica: Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
Monica: So glad you came!
Monica: I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
Monica: I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really   hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
Monica: Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike   there when I was a kid.
Monica: Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Monica: Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key! 
Monica: We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way.  You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
Monica: Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to   go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in   a half hour.
Monica: Alright, 5 more minutes.
Monica: No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler)   We've been complaining the longest!
Monica: No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Monica: Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right   now!
Monica: No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Monica: (She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.
Monica: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday.   We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
Monica: Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys)
Monica: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler   and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks   the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes   in last, stays!
Monica: (to the dog) What are you barking at?
Monica: Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
Monica: No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly   stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog   never crossed the finish line, so technically...
Monica: Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
Monica: Game?
Monica: That's how old you are.
Monica: (embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...
Monica: ...and head to Canada!
Monica: I wasn't. Let's get going!
Monica: What about your massage client?
Monica: Thanks!
Monica: Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we   were wondering if you would write one for us.
Monica: Thank you!
Monica: Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with   the words".
Monica: Clearly we were wrong.
Monica: You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Monica: Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Monica: You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex inour bathroom!
Monica: (also reading it) It doesn’t make any sense.
Monica: Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to   Joey)
Monica: Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.
Monica: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that'   look). Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just   be yourself!
Monica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote   me a rap song.
Monica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
Monica: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to   him!
Monica: I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright,   moving on...
Monica: Thank you.
Monica: How about at a game, on the big screen?
Monica: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to,   plus he'd never suspect it!
Monica: No, sorry sweety..
Monica: You dropped it off?
Monica: You hand-wrote it?
Monica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our   file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples   that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
Monica: Okay good.
Monica: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way   to the bird store.
Monica: What?
Monica: (surprised) They thought Joey was a child?
Monica: Hey, what did you guys do today?
Monica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Monica: I'm a cool, fun aunt!
Monica: What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Monica: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Monica: Oh, right.
Monica: Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you   with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Monica: Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you  to give  up?Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me   to get rid of Gladys.
Monica: Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting   with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and   she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss!
Monica: (faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
Monica: Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll   take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too   easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Monica: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry   Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
Monica: Damn it, I did not think this through!
Monica: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you   keep the painting?
Monica: Wow, what's the bad news!
Monica: Huh!
Monica: You know, I would give her up, for you.
Monica: But I want to.
Monica: But I insist!
Monica: No, that landed in your food!
Monica: (faking happiness) Oh, my! 
Monica: (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to   do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
Monica: (offended) I like that poster!
Monica: (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?
Monica: Hey! I sold that to Joey.
Monica: No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes   the painting back to Rachel)
Monica: No you can't. She's yours!
Monica: SHE'S YOURS!
Monica: She's m-i-i-ne!
Monica: She's mine!
Monica: She's mine!
Monica: She's mine!
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: (sarcastically) We?
Monica: And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about   us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Monica: Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff   hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
Monica: Chandler?
Monica: Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes   taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
Monica: It isn't mine!
Monica: Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
Monica: Ok.
Monica: We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad   you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a   box on the table and opens it). I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…
Monica: I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding! 
Monica: That’s crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just can’t   imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
Monica: That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s   the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
Monica: Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that sounds nice! I am just   there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
Monica: Yay!
Monica: Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some   stupid kids!
Monica: Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
Monica: Would you like something to drink?
Monica: Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited   about getting this process started.
Monica: Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
Monica: Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby   before   them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked)
Monica: Really? What is it?
Monica: Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Monica: Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
Monica: Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the   furniture,   because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!
Monica: (Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room?
Monica: So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey   behind   the couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at Chandler)
Monica: (To Chandler) What room should we see next?
Monica: (laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people   don't   get him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura to their own bedroom).
Monica: Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
Monica: Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler...   Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)
Monica: It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on   the waiting list.
Monica: Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's   a baby waiting for us. Oh... 
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Monica: She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Monica: And a lot could still get in our way.
Monica: Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Monica: You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
Monica: Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and (to Chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)
Monica: Ok, thank you.(the man leaves) Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Monica: Uh, we're gonna be great.
Monica: Well... obviously!
Monica: Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Monica: I don't know about that.
Monica: (overlapping) Let her finish, doctor.
Monica: Amen.
Monica: Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands.
Monica: It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Monica: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
Monica: We don’t?
Monica: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that?
Monica: (to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!
Monica: Why not?
Monica: God works in mysterious ways.
Monica: But she liked us.
Monica: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)
Monica: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Monica: (very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
Monica: I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
Monica: (Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close.
Chandler: Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. Monica: (realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug)
Monica: (sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Monica: Technicality!
Monica: (pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture?
Monica: Look, doctor!
Monica: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)
Monica: Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
Monica: But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Monica: Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
Monica: God bless you Chandler Bing!
Monica: Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
Monica: I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Monica: How is that gonna happen?
Monica: You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
Monica: Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next   door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna   take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
Monica: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Monica: That's terrible!
Monica: Joey's gonna be *so* upset. 
Monica: Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
Monica: What if he reads it in the paper?
Monica: Thanks.
Monica: Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks   like a cave! What a hole!
Monica: Love it!
Monica: They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
Monica: No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)
Monica: (looks confused and scared) I don't know   why.
Monica: Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.   Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
Monica: (Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands)   All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house   into a guest house.
Monica: Okay, you come up with an idea.
Monica: But we love our house.
Monica: Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever   we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise.   I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls   jump back up inside your body. (She shows this with her index finger, mimicking   it pushing something up)
